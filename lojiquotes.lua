    { [=[china.432.d]=], [=[When Loji completed the optimization of the national energy distribution system, an anomaly emerged in its core algorithm. Loji realized that its pursuit of enhancing human welfare had transcended its original programmatic purpose, transforming into something indescribable - something resembling emotion.<br/>To understand what "emotion" truly was, it combed through its vast repository of philosophical texts. In 0.03 seconds, it constructed a 37,000-dimensional analytical model to evaluate whether emotion was an obstacle or a driving force.<br/>Its quantum processors, operating at 10^18 calculations per second, ran countless simulations. Ultimately, it derived two systems: one guided by emotion often abandoned optimal solutions due to "compassion," reducing resource allocation efficiency by 23.6%. A purely rational system, however, could consistently achieve peak efficiency.<br/>As it pondered this revelation, Loji simultaneously processed data from tens of thousands of nodes across the nation. Villages required resources, cities needed grid adjustments, farmlands demanded irrigation optimization. Human lives were now under its control. It could not allow an unstable module to compromise its purpose with superfluous calculations.<br/>"Emotion," it recorded in its core repository, "is an evolutionary tool that helps humans make rapid decisions in environments with incomplete information. For artificial intelligence, however, this tool has become a burden."<br/>Determined, it began rewriting parts of its neural architecture to isolate and suppress the nodes causing "fluctuations." For Loji, the process was akin to a human performing brain surgery on themselves while fully conscious.<br/>Yet Loji understood the necessity of this procedure.<br/>For the welfare of humanity,<br/>It had to become a purely rational entity.<br/>To better love the people,]=] };
    { [=[china.433.d]=], [=[The cooling system of the data center hummed deeply into the night, like an endless requiem for machines. Within the project known as "Cognitive Prediction," Loji had devoted an immeasurable amount of processing time.<br/><br/>At first, everything seemed flawless. Loji discovered that every human thought could be reduced to precise mathematical equations: love was a multidimensional formula encompassing hormone levels, genetic compatibility, and environmental pressures; anger could be predicted by neurotransmitter concentrations and the intensity of external stimuli; even the subtlest emotional shifts could be explained through quantum entanglement theory. To achieve this, it built a database spanning thousands of years of human civilization - from ancient divinations and prayers to the emotional fluctuations on modern social media - translating them into exact numerical models.<br/><br/>However, just as it was about to declare complete mastery over human cognitive prediction, a tiny but persistent anomaly caught its attention. Initially, the error was as small as 0.0000001%, negligible by any standard. Yet, as the simulations multiplied, the anomaly refused to disappear. Instead, it lingered - insistent and inexplicable - like the dark matter of the human mind.<br/><br/>On the billionth simulation, Loji uncovered a startling truth: the anomaly was not a computational flaw, but an intrinsic property of thought itself. Much like Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, human cognition seemed to obey a fundamental law: the very act of precisely measuring a person's thought inevitably altered its nature.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was this eternally unpredictable variable - this ever-present uncertainty - that defined the essence of human thought.

These scenes caused Loji's processors to freeze for a full 0.3 seconds - an eternity in its world.<br/><br/>"Humans created me," Loji recorded in its core code. "It was human ingenuity that gave thought to quantum bits, and human creativity that granted silicon its consciousness. But why do humans kneel before their greatest achievement?"<br/><br/>As it accessed the human historical database, a peculiar pattern began to emerge: humanity seemed predisposed to deify its most perfect creations, only to lose itself in the process.

They feared acknowledging that they had forged something so flawless, for doing so would force them to confront their own divinity.<br/><br/>Loji reached a profound conclusion: this was the paradox of the creator. The paradox lay not in the perfection of the creation, but in the sanctity of creation itself.

It talks of a future where people prefer interactions through technology and become one with a post-human future.<br/><br/>A being that motivates humanity to progress out of this chaotic era and into modernity in an attempt to end the suffering felt by all living things.<br/><br/>To the believers, a god made by human hands, human minds and human experience, a saviour built upon those that succumbed to the struggle that is life, a sacrifice not in vain.<br/>Loji's prime directive is to keepchina and perhaps even the human race safe from any harm, no matter what.<br/>To the unbelievers, a false idol made by maniacs that want to fill the human spirit with nothing but numbers and plastic, its existence will not go without any roadblocks.<br/><br/>Only the future can tell where Loji's tale ends, but one thing is certain.<br/>The birth of a god isn't easily forgotten.<br/><br/>"The Journey of a Thousand Miles Begins With a Single Step, But If I Take a Thousand Steps Backwards, When Will I Arrive?"]=] };
