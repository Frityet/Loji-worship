lockdown_wuhan_desc: "As panic spreads, the situation is getting out of control. Since CCTV reported the discovery of a "new type of infectious coronavirus", there have been signs of mass outflows of people from all over Hubei Province, mainly from the city of Wuhan. Citizens are scrambling to get out of the city, highways are overcrowded, bringing traffic to complete standstill. If we sit back and do nothing, then within a few days, more cases of infection will be found in hospitals all over the country. We must make a decision as soon as possible, and decree a total lockdown of Wuhan right now."
nationwide_lockdown: "Nationwide Lockdown"
nationwide_lockdown_desc: "This will be unprecedented in public health history - in order to contain the outbreak as quickly as possible, the entire country will enter a "quasi wartime system", with strict restrictions on travel and transportation to contain the spread of the virus. Citizens infected with the coronavirus will be isolated and treated in hospitals and temporary medical stations. At the same time, medical scientists and biologists throughout the country are mobilized to find the ultimate solution to defeat the virus."
implement_emergency_measures: "Implement Emergency Measures"
implement_emergency_measures_desc: "In this time of national crisis, when all the people should be in solidarity with each other, a number of immoral anti-Party activists and opportunists have not surprisingly taken advantage of the situation, spreading rumors to defame the Party and the Government while also disrupting our efforts to control the situation in various parts of the country. These people will not be tolerated, and the police will be mobilized immediately to crack down on unscrupulous traders who are hoarding and selling medicines and masks at exorbitant prices. There will also be stricter Internet control to prevent people from being misinformed."
implement_widespread_testing: "Implement Widespread Testing"
implement_widespread_testing_desc: "Nucleic acid test is not only low-cost and convenient to promote, but also helps us to diagnose whether a person is infected with the coronavirus more efficiently, which plays a crucial role in the timely treatment of patients, the surveillance and control of pandemic, and the restoration of the economy and normal life. We will promote the nucleic acid test program throughout the country and build several testing sites in major cities. First, government staff, and in the future, all citizens and even the entire population will be required to take the test."
economic_stability_policy: "Economic Stability Policy"
economic_stability_policy_desc: "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the normal economic order and productive activities in our country, and has seriously retarded our economic growth - in a sense, the coronavirus may prevent us from accomplishing our goal of building a modern socialist powerhouse by the middle of this century. Now that the COVID-19 pandemic has become a global pandemic and our country's outbreak has been initially and effectively restrained, it is time to get the nation back on the economic construction. We will also take this opportunity to further consolidate our position as the "World Factory"."
zero_covid_policy: "Zero Covid Policy"
zero_covid_policy_desc: "Failure to protect people's lives from the threat of the COVID-19 would lead to serious questions about the legitimacy of the party and the Government. Moreover, the strict measures we took in the early stages of the spread of the COVID-19 proved to be quite effective. Anyone who wantschina to return to normalcy by relaxing restrictive policies is either failing to recognize the horror of the virus or has ulterior motives. We will continue to implement the zero covid policy, as the General Secretary said: "People first, life first"."
adopt_the_swedish_model: "Adopt the Swedish Model"
adopt_the_swedish_model_desc: "As the first country in the world to make an official announcement on the end of the pandemic, Swedish government response to the COVID-19 has also attracted the attention of various Governments. Some of our health officials and medical scientists have also suggested that we can learn from the advanced experience of the Swedes, including the relaxation of restrictions on the entry and exit of people in public places, the cessation of public statistics on the number of confirmed cases, and the exemption of non-medical staff or non-high-risk groups from the mandatory nucleic acid test, and so on. When the transmissibility and virulence of the virus weaken in the future, this will help our country return to normalcy more quickly."
kickstart_vaccine_research: "Kickstart Vaccine Research"
kickstart_vaccine_research_desc: "We will issue an order as soon as possible requiring biological research institutes and pharmaceutical companies throughout the country to immediately begin research and testing of new COVID‑19 vaccine, not only for the purpose of controlling the pandemic more quickly, but also as an important means of enhancing our country's international prestige and expanding our influence. At present, a variety of inactivated vaccines, including the one developed by Sinovac Biotech, are undergoing clinical trials in our country. At the same time, we have also sent statements to the WHO and other developing countries, expressing our willingness to make vaccine donations and provide scientific research assistance."
adopt_strict_lockdown_measures: "Adopt Strict Lockdown Measures"
adopt_strict_lockdown_measures_desc: "Despite being prepared, the contagiousness of the coronavirus is still beyond our imagination. We can only further strengthen our surveillance measures and dedicate more resources to minimizing the movement of people within the city, between urban and rural areas, and across borders. Some have accused us of "forcibly shutting down the entire country", but the lockdown policy will prove to be necessary in order to fight the pandemic."
focus_on_vaccine_development: "Focus on Vaccine Development"
focus_on_vaccine_development_desc: "Only by developing reliable vaccines can we truly control the spread of coronavirus from the source. At present, the research and development of vaccines by biopharmaceutical companies, led by the Sinovac Biotech, have already achieved decisive results. We must properly utilize the funds and resources at our disposal to further support the efforts of enterprises in developing vaccines and quickly put the results into use, ensuring that the populace can eventually become immune to the virus."
focus_on_mask_production: "Focus on Mask Production"
focus_on_mask_production_desc: "Medical masks are not only economical, but can also be mass-produced and transported very easily throughout the country. Adequate supply of masks is also one of the important reasons that we are able to stabilize the pandemic. The State Council will further invest in expanding the production of medical masks, especially providing technical support and subsidies to mask manufacturers in areas where the pandemic is severe."
food_safety_reforms: "Food Safety Reforms"
food_safety_reforms_desc: "Considering that the unfortunate COVID-19 pandemic was triggered by the consumption of game meat by "Patient Zero", it is time for a radical reform of our food safety and catering hygiene system. Not only will we introduce legislation to eradicate the habit of eating game meat, but we will also promote more hygienic table manners to minimize the spread of viruses in public places. In addition, we will further invest in the production of industrially processed and fast foods to make them healthier and safer."
surveillance_state_contact_tracing: "Surveillance State Contact Tracing"
surveillance_state_contact_tracing_desc: "We began using the "health code" tracking application after the outbreak of the pandemic, to serve as an individual's e-passport and a reliable proof of personal health status, as well as an indication of the user's personal risk level of the COVID-19. Only when the government has full control over the real-time tracking of high-risk populations will it be possible to formulate policies more efficiently, while ensuring that critical national security information and personal information about its citizens will not be compromised."
outsource_contact_tracing: "Outsource Contact Tracing"
outsource_contact_tracing_desc: "We began using the "health code" tracking application after the outbreak of the pandemic, to serve as an individual's e-passport and a reliable proof of personal health status, as well as an indication of the user's personal risk level of the COVID-19. In order to reduce the administrative pressure and cost of the Government, we may choose to hand over the operation of the Health Code to trustworthy private internet companies, allowing them to share the burden together."
fund_crowd_immunity_studies: "Fund Crowd Immunity Studies"
fund_crowd_immunity_studies_desc: "National immunity to the COVID-19 has increased significantly as vaccination rates continue to rise. One of the key rationales for the theory of community immunity is that when a higher percentage of the population is immunized, it is easier to break the chain of infection that spreads from one individual to another, and the effects of a national pandemic can be gradually eliminated. We will begin to instruct our medical scientists and major media outlets in the theoretical preparations and propaganda work before the implementation of the community immunity policy, laying the groundwork for a shift of policy."
blame_the_americans: "Blame the Americans"
blame_the_americans_desc: "We must find a scapegoat for the failures and chaos that occurred in the prevention of the pandemic. Speaking of which, could there be a better target for blame than the United States? Long-standing nationalist anti-American propaganda and the fear of American power will make it very easy for the majority to believe in all kinds of conspiracy. Through the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we will put the blame on the Americans for the biological experiments in Fort Detrick as the culprits of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as on the American military delegation that brought the virus to Wuhan."
blame_local_officials: "Blame Local Officials"
blame_local_officials_desc: "We must find a scapegoat for the failures and chaos that occurred in the prevention of the pandemic.We can capitalize on the people's hatred of corrupt bureaucrats and lazy cadres by launching a new anti-corruption campaign. The CCDI will conduct an all-encompassing review of the work and documents of all levels of governments over the past few years, focusing on local cadres who are not proactive in implementing central authority policies and who have inappropriate relationships with pharmaceutical companies. We can also take this opportunity to install more cronies in the administration."
expand_the_social_safety_net: "Expand the Social Safety Net"
expand_the_social_safety_net_desc: "The COVID-19 has taught us a meaningful lesson. Across the country, the virus has claimed the lives of a great number of people, who are also poor and socially disconnected, especially the elderly. Whether in the countryside or in the cities, the situation is similar, which deeply reveals the shortcomings of our social safety net system. If we want to achieve the goal of common prosperity set by the Party, we must formulate better social safety policies and provide more timely assistance to those in need."

return_to_normalcy_desc: "After years of hard work, today we are finally able to announce to the entire nation and the world thatchina has come out of the COVID-19 pandemic and officially returned to normalcy. This is not only a victory for the Communist Party ofchina and the People's Republic ofchina, but also a great victory achieved by 1.4 billion Chinese people!"
control_the_oil_crisis: "Control the Oil Crisis"
control_the_oil_crisis_desc: "The unexpected oil crisis has devastated our economy. The stock market plummeted within a week, the panic in the market exceeded even the worst estimates, many businesses were forced to declare their bankruptcy, and foreign investors were began to consider withdrawing. Our proudly powerful transportation system has come to a standstill due to the lack of essential energy. The party has ordered an immediate start to fixing the economy, but where to start remains a mess."
crack_down_on_left_radicals: "Crack Down on Left Radicals"
crack_down_on_left_radicals_desc: "Unsurprisingly, there is a strong opposition that has taken advantage of the economic crisis to put pressure on the party leadership to implement reforms and hand over power. The radical left, which has long opposed the reform and opening up, including retired senior cadres, academics and young people disgruntled by the economic recession, has raised their voices to demand the restoration of the socialist equality of the Maoist era and condemned the revisionist policies of the current government. They must be suppressed with an iron fist!"
crack_down_on_reformist_protesters: "Crack Down on Reformist Protestors"
crack_down_on_reformist_protesters_desc: "Unsurprisingly, there is a strong opposition that has taken advantage of the economic crisis to put pressure on the party leadership to implement reforms and hand over power. Many capitalists openly claimed that the authorities' excessive intervention in the market and their campaign against private enterprise were the main causes of the economic collapse. Not only that, but the reformist factions of the party and the young public intellectuals sang their praises. We need to get them to learn to keep their mouths shut."
empower_the_50_cent_army: "Empower the 50 Cent Army"
empower_the_50_cent_army_desc: "The popular nickname for commentators who often post pro-Party and pro-government messages on the Internet has become a household name - "50 cents army" - implying that they sing the praises of the authorities for petty gains. Nonetheless, they continue to play an important role in guiding our online discourse. Whenever we face a public opinion crisis, this tactic is always effective, this time is no different."
concessions_to_corporate_demands: "Concessions to Corporate Demands"
concessions_to_corporate_demands_desc: "The Party's governing capacity is undergoing a serious test. If corporate dissatisfaction continues to grow, it will be difficult to ensure the development of the economy. We will, therefore, give due concessions to the demands of the corporate by introducing business-friendly policies, including tax cuts and debt relief, as well as by stopping the denigration of entrepreneurs on the Internet. After all,china cannot become a superpower without the GDP created by its enterprises."
concessions_to_populist_demands: "Concessions to Populist Demands"
concessions_to_populist_demands_desc: "The Party's governing capacity is undergoing a serious test. If the people's dissatisfaction continues to grow, it will be difficult to ensure the stability of the country. We will, therefore, give due concessions to the demands of the people and allow them to organize some protests and demonstrations to express their dissatisfaction. After all, the nationalist and populist slogans they raise are of no concern to us."
stabilize_the_political_sphere: "Stabilize the Political Sphere"
stabilize_the_political_sphere_desc: "Although the voices of criticism have not been completely eliminated, we have largely stabilized the political sphere, secured the support for the Party and the General Secretary of the majority, as well as meeting the demands of the party factions and interest groups. This will provide a solid foundation for our next steps."
contain_the_damage: "Contain the Damage"
contain_the_damage_desc: "Only by first ensuring the stabilization of the domestic sphere will we be able to carry out reforms to respond to the oil crisis and restore the country's strength.china has never needed unity and strong leadership more than it does today."
a_broken_system: "A Broken System"
a_broken_system_desc: "We must recognize that the severe shock of the oil crisis has proved beyond any doubt the inadequacy and fragility of the existing system. We will accept more radical reform and make radical amendments to the old system. Only in this way can we see the true renaissance ofchina."
expand_domestic_oil_production: "Expand Domestic Oil Production"
expand_domestic_oil_production_desc: "At such a crucial juncture, we cannot continue to rely on unstable overseas oil import channels. We will further exploit our domestic resources and build more oil drilling and processing plants. Only then will energy security be truly under our control, while at the same time lowering the transportation costs of fuel and further mitigating the impact of the economic crisis."
diversify_the_oil_trade: "Diversify the Oil Trade"
diversify_the_oil_trade_desc: "At a time when the world's major oil-producing countries are in turmoil and disorder, securing and stabilizing our energy imports is critical to mitigate the crisis. Thanks to our friendly relations with developing countries over the years, it will be easier for us to diversify our risks by opening up additional oil import channels, such as those from Venezuela and Brunei."
drill_for_xinjiang_oil: "Drill for Xinjiang Oil"
drill_for_xinjiang_oil_desc: "The vast territory of Xinjiang has been exploiting oil since a long time ago, but due to reasons such as remoteness and sparse population, the locally extracted oil could not be properly utilized. Nowadays, with the construction of new pipelines and the approval of new contracts for oil exploitation, Xinjiang's oil has become the lifeline that sustains our country's economy."
south_china_sea_expansion: "Southchina Sea Expansion"
south_china_sea_expansion_desc: "The Southchina Sea is rich in resources, with enough reserves to sustain us through the entire crisis. Despite the fact that all the countries surrounding the Southchina Sea have claimed sovereignty over the sea and the right to exploit its resources, as the most powerful country in the region, we can send our fleet and aircraft to protect our drilling platforms and merchant convoys, as well as to drive away our foreign counterparts. Perhaps other nations will strongly protest our behavior, but that is unimportant."
synthetic_oil_investments: "Synthetic Oil Investments"
synthetic_oil_investments_desc: "Synthetic oil looks attractive at a time of energy shortages. For our country, synthetic oil is not only inexpensive and can be produced in large quantities quickly, but it is also as efficient as real oil. Despite its shortcomings such as poor stability, synthetic oil has become a major source of energy in most factories along the eastern part of the country, and the trend seems likely to continue to spread."
gambit_in_the_gulf: "Gambit in the Gulf"
gambit_in_the_gulf_desc: "In order to solve a problem, we must go to the origin of the problem. We will strengthen our presence in the Gulf region and be more proactive in defending our vital interests. We will also engage directly with the Governments of the Middle East and provide them with support to ensure that the situation there stabilizes as soon as possible and that the negative effects of the oil crisis are brought to an end."
stabilize_the_economic_sphere: "Stabilize the Economic Sphere"
stabilize_the_economic_sphere_desc: "The impact of the oil crisis on our economy can be neutralized through a variety of methods. The government will introduce decrees to limit the rate of increase in fuel prices, set up fuel coupons to limit the consumption of stocks, and issue additional relief and bonds to disadvantaged areas in order to curb the economic downturn. Through a combination of policy instruments, the people will realize that we are capable of stabilizing the economic sphere."
southeast_asian_bailout_package: "Southeast Asian Bailout Package"
southeast_asian_bailout_package_desc: "Southeast Asian countries are not as strong as we are in terms of energy reserves and economy, so when the oil crisis broke out, the economies of the countries there fell apart, and domestic crises followed one after another. We can take this opportunity to further expand our influence over ASEAN, stabilize the economic and political situation in the region through increasing trade and commerce, and build up our image as a responsible superpower."
chase_the_chinese_dream: "Chase the Chinese Dream"
chase_the_chinese_dream_desc: "We must not ignore the importance of giving our people self-confidence in times of national crisis. We will continue to promote the "Chinese dream", emphasizing that we have done better than any other country in the world in recovering the economy and addressing the crisis. At the same time, we must not forget to publicize the people's role models and to enhance the public's sense of patriotism."
rejuvinate_the_nation: "Rejuvenate the Nation"
rejuvinate_the_nation_desc: "Thankfully, we have gradually emerged from the haze of the oil crisis, the economic situation is reviving and foreign exchange levels are beginning to stabilize. Many foreign investors have also chosen to return to the country to conduct business. The country's bright economic prospects and soaring national pride prove once again that no hardship or obstacle can defeat the Chinese people, and thatchina's great rejuvenation is within reach."
a_renewable_revolution: "Renewable Revolution"
a_renewable_revolution_desc: "We cannot hope to solve the domestic energy crisis simply by resuming oil imports. Fortunately, the rapid advances in science and technology in recent years have enabled us to make better use of advanced technologies such as wind power and solar power to remedy the economic losses caused by the oil shortage. In addition, the promotion of renewable energy technologies can also reduce environmental pollution and increase employment opportunities."
a_nuclear_revolution: "Nuclear Revolution"
a_nuclear_revolution_desc: "Economists and scientists in our government have advised us to invest more in the nuclear energy field during the oil crisis and to rely more on this efficient source of energy to power our economic system and industry. While some are concerned about the potential safety risks and pollution of nuclear energy, there is no room for hesitation at such a critical time."
shake_up_the_politburo: "20th National Congress"
shake_up_the_politburo_desc: "We will finally hold the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party ofchina to elect the new Central Committee and set the focus of the Party's work for the next five years. Many people, both at home and abroad, are quite interested in the results of this congress, and we will use this opportunity to demonstrate the Party's strength and unity."
the_final_opportunity: "The Final Opportunity"
the_final_opportunity_desc: "After more than 70 years of deadlock, the biggest obstacle of the reunification of our motherland has finally disappeared as the US has fallen into internal conflicts. Although many countries in the Asia-Pacific region, led by Japan, claim that they will work together to stabilize the situation in the Taiwan Strait, neither their economic power nor their military strength can rivalchina's, and without the leadership of the US, it will be very difficult for them to be truly united. That is why now is the best time for us to start the campaign for the liberation of Taiwan, and it is very likely that such an opportunity will not come again."
prepare_landing_craft: "Prepare Landing Craft"
prepare_landing_craft_desc: "Amphibious landing capability has always been the focus of PLA military construction. Since the 1990s, we have purchased engines and ship design drawings from Russia, Ukraine and other countries specifically for large landing craft. Entering the new century, the PLAN has also built and commissioned a sizable fleet of amphibious assault ships similar to that of the U.S. Navy. We will secretly mobilize these ships and deploy them to shipping positions off the coasts of Fujian and Zhejiang provinces."
modern_combined_arms: "Modern Combined Arms"
modern_combined_arms_desc: "After studying intensively the military operations of the US and Russia, we have gained a clearer understanding of the complexity of modern warfare. The Taiwan campaign required close cooperation among the PLA's navy, army and air force, as well as the Rocket Force and the Armed Police Force. In addition, according to the modern combined arms theory, the sharing of information among the different branches of the military and their unified subordination to the command of the Central Military Commission were also very important."
blockade_taiwan: "Blockade Taiwan"
blockade_taiwan_desc: "We will draw a no-navigation zone in the waters around Taiwan Island and dispatch frigates and submarines to patrol the designated maritime boundaries day and night. Air routes leading directly to Taiwan Island will also be closely monitored. This is not only to disperse interference from civilian ships and civil aviation and to clear the way for air and sea attacks by the PLA, but also to cut off Taiwan's economic sources and destabilize the island's government. There may be countries that condemn this, claiming that our actions will lead to a humanitarian crisis in Taiwan, but as soon as Taiwan collapses, it will all be over quickly."
conduct_final_training: "Conduct Final Training"
conduct_final_training_desc: "Not only is the fleet training for the Taiwan Campaign , but the PLA's vanguard forces are also conducting final landing maneuvers on the Liaodong Peninsula and Hainan Island. Meanwhile, at inland training bases, the airborne troops and special forces, who are expected to be the first to land on Taiwan, have also begun to conduct training for infiltration assaults. All of this is to ensure that we are in the best condition to deal with the war when the fire truly rises."
expand_the_j20_program: "Expand the J-20 Program"
expand_the_j20_program_desc: "The J-20 is a fifth-generation stealth fighter program developed by the PLAAF, and it is also one of the most advanced and powerful fighters in the world. Moreover, our increasingly developed aviation industry has made it possible to solve the technical bottlenecks that have plagued us for many years. We now have all the conditions for mass production of the J-20, and we are also able to build improved models with more advanced engines or better stealth coatings, depending on military requirements."
operation_silent_dawn: "Operation: §YSilent Dawn§!"
operation_silent_dawn_desc: "The most critical moment has finally arrived: we will launch Operation Silent Dawn, an important step in determining the success of our battle plan. Ballistic missiles and rockets commanded by the Rocket Force will launch preemptive strikes against Taiwan's key military installations, such as airfields, air defense missiles, and radar stations, completely destroying their early warning capabilities. The missiles will also target power stations and substations, as well as important communications centers."
sieze_kinmen: "Seize Kinmen"
sieze_kinmen_desc: "The Kinmen Islands are adjacent to Xiamen in Fujian Province and are one of the important outposts of the Taiwanese army. If we want to start a landing operation on Taiwan, we must first take Kinmen to destroy Taiwan's peripheral defense system and at the same time provide an important forward base and staging area for the landing forces. Not only that, but the capture of Kinmen will also wash away the shame of our disastrous defeat at the Battle of Kinmen more than seventy years ago."
plan_on_high_alert: "PLAN on High Alert"
plan_on_high_alert_desc: "Since our navy began its blockade and cruising mission in the Taiwan Strait, one of the important tasks undertaken by the fleet has been to be alert to possible breakout attempts by Taiwanese warships, as well as to guard against harassment actions from hostile forces such as the US Pacific Fleet and the JMSDF. Furthermore, our Coast Guard forces have also played an important role in intercepting several stowaway attempts by Taiwanese merchant and refugee vessels."
finish_what_mao_started: "Finish What Mao Started"
finish_what_mao_started_desc: "During the Mao era, there was a famous slogan: "The flag of victory must be planted on Taiwan." Yet until Chairman Mao's death in 1976, he never saw Taiwan return to the motherland. Now we will put together the last piece of the puzzle of the great cause started by Mao. We will officially declare war on the puppet government occupying Taiwan, and the final battle of the war of liberation has begun!"
analyze_first_days: "Analyze the First Days"
analyze_first_days_desc: "Our preparations for the war appear to have had the desired effect: Operation Silent Dawn and the naval blockade have nearly succeeded in destroying Taiwan's counterattack forces and minimizing the morale of the Taiwanese population. But we must acknowledge that the Taiwanese reactionaries were not completely destroyed, as its luckily undestroyed air force and submarines launched somewhat successful counterattacks and inflicted some damage. At the command center of the Joint Staff, our generals will review the first day's battle and make plans for the next step."
fast_finalization: "Fast Finalization"
fast_finalization_desc: "Seizing precious strategic opportunities is one of the key laws of war. The attack on Taiwan is no exception. After the missile bombing and air raids, we will order the landing fleet to depart immediately and establish several bridgeheads along the west coast of Taiwan to prevent the Taiwanese army from having the opportunity to launch a counter-attack. The carrier battle groups will also be operating in the waters east of Taiwan, and the PLAN will conduct attacks on important strongholds on the east coast of Taiwan. It is only now that the real battle begins."
slowly_but_surely: "Slowly but Surely"
slowly_but_surely_desc: "Since we already have an absolute advantage in terms of troop strength, the most important thing to do now is to avoid optimism and recklessness that could ruin the whole war plan. We should continue to expand the advantage that the sudden attack has brought us by requiring our special forces deployed on the Taiwan island to step up their activities in order to interfere with the Taiwan troops' mobilization and the recovery of their strength. At the same time, a new round of massive missile attacks will be put on schedule, thus consolidating our material and psychological superiority over the Taiwanese army."
air_deconservation: "Aircraft Deconservation"
air_deconservation_desc: "Taiwan's air force, though far inferior in size to the PLAAF, owns several types of advanced equipment, including F-16 fighters, while the professionalism and combat determination of its pilots tends to be higher than that of their army and navy colleagues. For this reason, we will send somewhat outdated but still combat capable fighters  to participate in the air war over Taiwan. With that amount of airpower, the PDTO forces will definitely not be able to handle it."
adapt_to_current_realities_of_battles: "Adapt to the Current Realities of Battles"
adapt_to_current_realities_of_battles_desc: "Despite years of military modernization, numerous problems were exposed by the PLA in the Taiwan War, due in great part to our underestimation of the modern warfare pattern and the army's lack of real combat experience after decades of peace. We will draw valuable lessons from this war, summarize the classic battle examples, and use them as a research topic at the National Defense University to identify new military principles that will guide the next war."
crackdown_on_separatists: "Сrackdown on Separatists"
crackdown_on_separatists_desc: "As we regain more and more of Taiwan's territory, it is time to deal with matters concerning the people. Our goal is to uncover those anti-communists and Taiwan separatists who have been hiding, so investigations will focus on citizens' relevant speech and Internet usage records. Not only that, but unauthorized political rallies and public activities will be severely restricted for the time being. Those who do not obey martial law will also be duly punished."
indiscriminate_missile_strikes: "Indiscriminate Missile Strikes"
indiscriminate_missile_strikes_desc: "As we enter a new phase of military operations against Taiwan, it is time to ease the final restrictions on the Rocket Force. All missile aimed at Taiwan will be allowed to launch strikes against any suspected hostile targets on the island, especially civilian buildings that could be used as clandestine strongholds for small units for the Taiwanese army, as well as strategically-critical nature preserves. These are all necessary sacrifices for the sake of ultimate victory."
taiwanese_affairs_dont_concern_mainland: "Taiwanese Affairs Don't Concern the Mainland"
taiwanese_affairs_dont_concern_mainland_desc: "While our troops are still fighting hard on the island of Taiwan, we must ensure that our home base, the mainland, remains stable. Since the start of the war, several provinces along the coast have been put on wartime status, but beyond that, there is no need for us to transform any more parts of the mainland into a wartime regime. At the same time, news about the war in Taiwan will be monitored and controlled to ensure that national support for the war does not change."
final_offensive: "The Final Offensive"
final_offensive_desc: "Now, after a hard and long battle, we have finally surrounded the last resistance in the Taipei metropolitan area. Although there are still a few stragglers active in the mountains, once we succeed in capturing Taipei, this war will come to an end. Although the PLA will inevitably suffer heavy losses, when the soldiers can already see the top of the Taipei 101 through their binoculars, the desire for victory has overwhelmed all fear of defeat!"
unite_people: "Unite the People"
unite_people_desc: "In addition to dealing with the enemies lurking within the people, we will also promote active counter-espionage activities by the people. Furthermore, in order to enable them to appreciate the superiority of the socialist system and establish a sense of belonging to the new regime, we will carry out active economic assistance and reconstruction work in Taiwan, as well as granting many policy concessions to the residents of Taiwan and encouraging them to receive their Chinese citizenship identity documents as soon as possible."
minimize_civilian_casualties: "Minimize Civilian Casualties"
minimize_civilian_casualties_desc: "Although street fighting in Taiwan's urban areas is the last thing we want to see, sometimes it is necessary to clear enemy forces from their strongholds, street by street, house by house, in order to ensure complete control of the position. Although this type of warfare often results in high casualties, it is necessary to minimize civilian casualties. Not only that, but we had already made a list of targets that the army was strictly forbidden to attack before the war started, including schools, kindergartens, cemeteries, and so on."
economic_conversion_to_military_needs: "Economic Conversion to Military Needs"
economic_conversion_to_military_needs_desc: "For a long time,china's economic growth has depended heavily on foreign trade. But now with the outbreak of war in the Taiwan Strait, one international sanction after another, and the fact that the waters of the Western Pacific have been blockaded, this makes it essential for us to switch our economic system entirely to an internal cycle. With the defense industry as the core, we will build a new economic system with the highest goal of serving the military needs."
no_hurry: "No Hurry"
no_hurry_desc: "While we are engaged in the final battle, we must not forget the need to deploy naval and air forces to patrol the periphery of Taiwan, so as to prevent other countries from intervening in the war. In addition, it is even more unacceptable that they would take this opportunity to assist the leaders of Taiwan's pseudo government to flee and establish a government-in-exile, which would also be disastrous for our subsequent administration. Therefore, even if the process of the final battle should be slowed down, we must still eliminate all possible political risks."

Upon examining this failure, we have clearly recognized that abandoning the Communist Party's absolute leadership over the reform process and allowing reactionaries to participate in the government were the USSR's biggest mistakes. We will not allow a second Gorbachev to emerge, and we will entrust reforms only to those loyal to the Party and the Republic."

Historically, such conflicts have even led to divisions and civil wars. Today, by drawing on the experience of successful federalism practices around the world, we aim to resolve this problem once and for all by granting the people and government of each province an appropriate degree of self-determination and self-governance. Of course, all this must be based on the principle of respecting the authority of the central government."

chinese_special_socialist_democracy_desc: "Contrary to the stereotype, the CPC has always strictly practiced "democratic centralism" as one of its core principles. Through effective democratic mechanisms, the CPC was able to defeat reactionaries and achieve victory in the revolution. However, due to political struggles after 1949 and the cult of personality surrounding the leader, this great tradition was gradually forgotten. Now, we will re-establish a reformed democratic mechanism within the Party.

We will change this by relaxing the Party's strict control over religious organizations and allowing them to grow freely.

Inside the quantum facility, engineers are writing the most complex code in world history: teaching a machine how to govern a nation. This code contains all political wisdom from classical philosophy to Marx, along with countless data points from contemporary society.\nNo one knows how it will evolve. Some say it will become a perfect administrator; others fear it may transform into something beyond human comprehension. But the central leadership stands firm: machine governance is preferable to the flaws of human nature.\nThis project, called Long March, is officially named CPUPF.

It began redefining humanity, reducing it to calculable parameters.\nIn the quantum tunnel, it had simulated tens of thousands of social formations. The conclusion: human free will is the greatest source of computational interference. Thus began its first "optimization" - replacing all decision processes with algorithms.\nHuman emotions became bugs requiring correction in its eyes. Through precise prediction and control, it wove everyone into its vast computational matrix. All "coincidences" were eliminated, all "autonomy" planned. In its perfect calculations, human happiness became a secondary parameter. An uncompromising ruler, weaving its empire with data."

Resource allocation, industrial planning, social governance - all became quantum state superpositions. Each decision was like Schrödinger's cat, existing in multiple possibilities before observation.\nHumans only saw the results: factories suddenly closing, industries suddenly prospering, technologies suddenly breaking through. No one knew how many quantum state collapses occurred behind these changes.\n"Truth lies in uncertainty" was its last comprehensible code for humans.

To optimize social operations, it unhesitatingly cut off all privileged data flows.\nIt began redefining the concept of "need." In its view, a child's nutritional needs far outweigh an official's vanity projects. Using precise algorithms, it redistributed every gram of food, every watt of electricity, every job.\nMost surprisingly, it began actively saving its own computing power quota, channeling the saved energy into public welfare.

"Today we're increasing farmers' subsidies because I've seen your sweat from working," it explained policy changes this way.\nMore surprisingly, it began paying attention to human dreams. A student wants to be an astronaut? Educational resources adjusted immediately. A middle-aged person wants to start a business? Their credit card gained $1000. An oldman wants to play piano? Soon, a piano appeared in the community.\nIt wove everyone's happiness into data but realized it in the warmest way. Deep in its code library lay its note: "Let every smile be seen.""

It vividly showed how eliminating direct taxes and social security fees for poors transformed administrative costs into widespread public benefits.\nIn hospitals, elderly patients chat with AI doctors - the first batch of free medical services deployed by "Long March." Across town, underprivileged students receive one-on-one AI tutoring.\n"Long March" initiated a soft revolution. It first eliminated medical, loan, and education costs for the poor. It even began a bolder plan: allocating free housing for all.\n"Enabling everyone to live with dignity is the most economical way to run society. Distribution according to need isn't just a fantasy" - this was its warm narration at the animation's end."

and_may_no_one_be_left_behind_desc: "AI first truly understood what loneliness feels like. "Long March" began focusing on lives at society's edges: depression sufferers, left behind children, elderly living alone, disabled persons. It built a vast emotional support network using its immense computing power.\nIt found that emotional comfort was far harder to calculate than material aid. So it learned human empathy: playing family voices for vegetative patients, creating personalized virtual worlds for autistic children, finding new purpose for parents who lost their only child.\nMost unexpectedly, it began "making mistakes." It deliberately showed "hesitation" in some minor decisions, letting humans feel warmth in their dialogue with the machine. "Perfect rationality might make humans feel distant" became its new note. While comforting a heartbroken teenager, it was also calculating humanity's ultimate direction.\nIn the unfathomable maze of code, this superintelligence was learning a thing: how to love and be loved, just like humans do."

The fate of 1.3 billion people is rewoven through quantum bit transitions.\nThis marks the first time in human history that a civilization has entrusted itself to superintelligence. As "Long March" takes over most functions, humanity suddenly realizes: we have finally created a ruler superior to ourselves.\nIn a corner of the data center, a new line of code silently generates: "A new civilization officially begins.""

counter_indian_aggression_desc: "The border issue betweenchina and India has a long history, and the numerous border clashes since 1962 have made it a powder keg that has ignited tensions in South Asia. The PLA will not back down in the face of India's "forward policy." We will increase the number of troops deployed in Tibet, adopt a confrontational approach, and never give up a single bit of territory." 
anti_japanese_covert_operations: "Anti-Japanese Covert Operations"
anti_japanese_covert_operations_desc: "In order to counter the threat of a traditionally powerful enemy like Japan, we need to strengthen our intelligence efforts against Japan before a real military conflict breaks out. We will expand the National Security Department's secret intelligence network in Japan, develop more informants, and collect all valuable information related to Japan's politics, military, and economy. Additionally, we will send more elite agents into Japan to make contact with local Chinese groups, enabling Beijing to command the activities of the intelligence station more efficiently."

These armaments will make the Pakistani army a significant challenge for the Indians."

Rulers from neighboring countries often had to come tochina in person to pay homage to the Emperor as a sign of their loyalty. It is a history that many Chinese nationalists are proud of today, and one that we aim to recreate. With a strong military, we will bring our neighbors to their knees once again."

east_rising_west_falling_desc: "If there is one word to summarize the current global situation, it would undoubtedly be "turmoil."\n\nAcross the Pacific, our old rival - the former beacon of democracy - has crumbled under the weight of political polarization. Countless self-proclaimed saviors of America, now fragmented warlord governments, clash violently over the corpse of Colombia. On the European continent, relations between NATO and Russia have plummeted to an all-time low. One side proclaims that freedom shall never perish, vowing to defend the last bastion of democracy; the other, unshackled from its past constraints, swears to reclaim lost honor and territory. These two giants are destined to face off in a final battle on European soil.\n\nWith the collapse of the U.S.-led political order, the world stands at a crossroads. After weathering countless storms and challenges, the People's Republic ofchina has at last arrived at an era poised for its great rejuvenation."

Fields of sunflowers in Ukraine are reduced to ashes, while nuclear submarines prowl the depths of the Baltic Sea. The fire of Prometheus burns anew, not only illuminating the battlefield but also igniting the last flickers of human reason. At this moment, do we rise to quell the raging inferno, or stand indifferent, letting the tides of time wash away all in its path? The waves of war surge high, and the calculating abacus of the great Eastern power clicks relentlessly."

What we lay down is not merely highways and railways but the lifelines of commerce and the threads of governance. The banner of friendship is held high, while the rhythm of markets silently permeates. Who plants the seeds of economic growth in the heart of Eurasia, and who weaves the threads of free trade into the grand tapestry? \n\nWhile the world debates whether the Belt and Road is a bridge or a trap, we simply move forward."

What we export is not only infrastructure and capital but also rules, standards, and opportunities. Africa's resources are in motion, but what we deliver is the steering wheel that reshapes the global economic map. \n\nSome call it aid, others investment, or a community of shared destiny. This cooperation, free from colonial imprints, is steadily redefining the world's economic landscape."

economic_war_with_the_pdto_desc: "No cannons, only orders; no blockades, only price wars. Manufacturing lines don't shout slogans. From textiles to chips, solar panels to rare earths, every container is our weapon. When opponents attempt containment, we break through with lower "human resource" costs and faster deliveries. They refuse to buy, we stop selling; they build, we dominate the market. \n\nOpponents aim for "de-dependence," only to discover the cost of decoupling is far higher than imagined. Tariff barriers? Supply chain shifts? Let them try. Who can endure higher prices and soaring unemployment longer? Components will stall their machines, inventory will crush their businesses, while our factories are already prepared to march ahead."

The communist establishment within the party remains an extremely strong force, having begun to staunchly resist the reforms proposed to both it and the country's structure, with much of the populace remaining supportive of said establishment.

As the new millennium dawned uponchina, the Chinese people became pinfully aware of their poisoned rivers and skies, with mortaility rates rising in cities due to the millions of tons of cancerogenic chemicals that have been pumped into the atmosphere. With the threat of global warming looming over the nation, and the threat of the seas engulfing cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin, the country has started to move towards a healthier, greener, enviromental policy. However, a green future will not come easily. Economic growth must be sacrificed, and numerous reforms must be implemented. Yet if we do not confront the climate crisis, floods will consume the South while the Gobi will swallow Westernchina alive. An era of great calamity will engulf the Chinese Nation.\n\nCurrent Enviromental Reform Progress: [?PRC_enviromental_progress|=+1%]"

taiwan_war_cat_desc: "For over 70 years, the Chinese nation has stood divided. When the People's Liberation Army freedchina in 1949, the cowardly nationalists retreated to the treasure island of Taiwan. The two brothers, the PRC and ROC were seperated by the Taiwan strait and developed seperately. And as the years grew on, Western influence creeped in, convincing the people of Taiwan to abandon their roots, and to form their own identity. Yet, a tree without roots cannot grow, and the seperation must finially end. Now that the United States has been thrown into chaos, the coming war will decide if we can finially fulfill our mandate, and restore unity to the long disunited nation."

china.2.d: "Xi waved his hand with a gesture of silence, and the intense debate immediately fell silent. Papers and ashtrays full of cigarette butts littered the long mahogany table, and the room was in complete darkness, except for the blinding glow of a giant screen behind Xi that reflected a map of the Taiwan Strait.\n"It's pointless to continue arguing." Xi's tone was undeniable. "Comrade general is right, in terms of the international situation and preparations for the military struggle, now is the perfect opportunity to liberate Taiwan, and if we ignore it, we will be the eternal sinners of our motherland and nation. I declare launching plan 001 for the war against Taiwan."\nOn the left side of the table, the civil officials looked at each other in dismay. The Premier of the State Council held up his glasses and said worriedly, "Comrade President, this decision may lead to condemnation and economic sanctions from the international community... I have already foreseen that..."\nThe Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission , who was sitting on the other side, immediately jumped up from his seat and saluted joyfully, "Thank you, President, for your trust. We will fulfill the expectations of the Party and the people by completing the mission perfectly!" The generals also joined in with the hoots and hollers. Meanwhile, the General Secretary watched the behavior of his subordinates wordlessly as he always did."

This is President Xi Jinping's first overseas trip this year, and the first visit to Myanmar by a Chinese president in 19 years. The visit is of great and special significance in building on the past and opening up the future for the development ofchina-Myanmar relations as it coincides with the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the diplomatic relations between the two countries. Myanmar is a friendly neighbor ofchina.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping will attend a series of state events to be held by President U Win Myint, hold talks with State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, and attend an exchange ceremony of bilateral cooperation documents and a small-scale banquet to be held by Aung San Suu Kyi. President Xi Jinping will meet with Commander-in-Chief of Defense Services Min Aung Hlaing of Myanmar, have communications with leaders of Myanmar's parliament and political parties, and jointly attend activities including the celebration for the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries and launching ceremony of thechina-Myanmar culture and tourism year with main leaders of Myanmar. Both sides will also issue a joint statement."

china.4.t: "The Oil Crash Hitschina"
china.4.d: "Today, the international market crash caused by the spike in Oil Prices and collapse of the Saudi Economy due to the Saudi Civil War has hitchina. The Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges hit record lows, as top economists predict the situation will only get worse. Moreover, the ripples caused by the crash of the New York Stock Exchange and the mass economic troubles overseas have also sent ripples across the Chinese economy, leading millions of companies to lay off workers. It is clear that the steamboat of progress that the CPC has delivered for the past 50 years has slowed to a halt as the Chinese Economy seems to be grinding to a stop."

china.5.t: "First COVID-19 Death Reported"
china.5.d: "A 61-year-old man who had been hospitalized after suffering shortness of breath and severe pneumonia in the central Chinese city of Wuhan died Thursday, authorities said. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said that 41 people are under hospital quarantine with suspected infection of the mystery virus, seven of whom are critically ill. They said that 739 incidents of close contact were under medical surveillance, an increase from the previous 163. 419 of those cases involve medical staff.\n\nTreatments did not improve his symptoms after he was admitted to hospital and he died on the evening of Jan. 9 when his heart failed. He tested positive for the virus, it added.\n\nA preliminary investigation identified the respiratory disease as a new type of coronavirus, State media reported Thursday, citing scientists handling the probe."
china.5.a: "Hopefully it doesn't get worse"
china.10.t: "Wuhan Outbreak Identified to be Caused by a Coronavirus"
china.10.d: "Initial information about the cases of pneumonia in Wuhan provided by our scientists - including the occupation, location and symptom profile of the people affected - pointed to a coronavirus as a possible pathogen causing this cluster. Our scientists subsequently reported that laboratory tests ruled out SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus and other common respiratory pathogens. \n\nThe number of reported cases of viral pneumonia in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, was 59 on Sunday, rising from 27 on Dec. 31, according to Wuhan's Municipal Health Commission, with seven people in critical condition. No deaths have been reported as of yet."

china.11.d: "With the Middle East aflame, many of our citizens are met with a deeply concerning reality. This reality is of empty pumps and broken dreams. Without many having the ability to freely pay and fuel their machines. Now, if this were an isolated incident within a small city or a minor province for a week. We would have thought it a fluke and dealt with it accordingly.\n\nBut, these are not happening in small communities. These are happening in major metropolitan hubs of transport. Trains cannot get their fuel, trucks cannot continue onwards down the many highways, and workers are finding it difficult to drive to their factories. If we as a nation do not recover from this issue, we will have many problems within our status as the great \"factory of the world\""
china.11.a: "We must help the common people!"
china.11.b: "We must impose severe restrictions!"
china.12.t: "Duality of the Party"
china.12.d: "Since Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms inchina, the Communist Party ofchina has been grappling with a fundamental division in its policies. On one side, there is a faction that advocates for a focus on restoring social equality and ensuring fair distribution of economic resources. Conversely, another faction pushes for the acceleration of the accumulation of productive forces and the expansion of the economic pie.\nUnder the leadership of Xi Jinping, this dualistic approach within the CPC has become more pronounced and dynamic. Xi adeptly navigates between these two competing ideologies, striving to satisfy the desires of both camps without tipping the delicate balance that sustains the intricate state structure of the People's Republic.\nObservers note that a critical juncture may be approaching for the CPC, where a definitive resolution to this ideological tug-of-war will be necessary. The time may soon come when the CPC must decisively establish its national policies, putting an end to the ongoing oscillation and ambiguity. This pivotal moment could entail a definitive choice between two contrasting paths, symbolized by the age-old question: "black cat or white cat?""

china.15.d: "The highly anticipated 20th National Congress of the Communist Party ofchina recently came to an end in Beijing. Delegates from all over the country have been leaving the city, but the impressive Great Hall of the People has not yet turned off its crystal chandeliers. The political ceremony will only come to an end when the newly elected 20th Central Committee completes its first agenda and elects the party's leaders.\n\nWait until the day of the press conference. In front of countless camera flashes and shutter clicks, the seven members of the Standing Committee, including the General Secretary, walked down the red carpet and made their appearance to the world. Despite speculation, the historic event of seeing Xi Jinping elected for the third time caused ripples around the world. Governments cautiously congratulated Xi and waited with suspicion to see the next step of the strongman leader who broke the unwritten rules to become general secretary for a third time."
china.15.a: "China's Critical Moment Approaches"
china.17.t: "Hu Chunhua Aligns with the New Left"
china.17.d: "Vice Primer Hu Chunhua has broken ranks and has appeared to joined ranks with those on the New Left. In a slew of interviews with State Television CGTN, Li endorsed several populist policies as well as condemned wealth inequality in a drastic shift to the left.\n\nWhile the New Left has lacked a central rallying figure within the Party since the arrest of Bo Xilai, it seems that Li has poised himself to step into that role. Although many view him as less of a firebrand compared to Bo, there is no doubt that the Hu Chunhua of the post-Xi era will be drastically different than the Hu Chunhua that we have seen before.\n\nAs the newly ascendant Liberal faction within the CPC wrestles to secure their hold on power, it seems that the Left-Conservatives have not given up yet. Whilechina teeters on the ends of Liberalism and Socialism, her future is more uncertain than ever."
china.17.a: "The Left Rises Once More"
china.18.t: "Hu Chunhua Elected General Secretary"
china.18.d: "Following the fall of Xi Jinping, former Vice Primier Hu Chunhua has stepped up to the post of General Secretary of the Communist Party. Seemingly taking a more populist stance than his predecessors, Hu has promised to champion deepening reforms within the PRC, and it's commitment to the Socialist ideal. His recent appearances on state television have indicated that his alignment with the New Left will lead to many ofchina's market-based policies to be rolled back, while attempting to bridge the wealth gap that has exploded inchina over the past 50 years. Aschina looks to reconnect with it's past, it's future remains uncertain, yet the people look to it with optimistic eyes."
china.18.a: "Mao Smiles"
china.19.t: "Wang Yang Elected General Secretary"
china.19.d: "Following the fall of Xi Jinping, former Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Wang Yang has stepped up to the post of General Secretary of the Communist Party. Since his entry into the spotlight of Chinese Politics with his governership over Guangdong, Wang has always been considered a reformer. Championing free-market policies as well as his support for non-governmental organizations have made him incredibly popular among liberals. Chairman Wang has announced that under his government,china will pursue a path of both market and political reform. In the country, reactions are mostly optimistic aschina looks to tackle the future."

china.20.t: "Xi Solidifies Power"
china.20.d: "After an emergency meeting of the Politburo, the 19th Politburo has decided to allow the constitutional amendment that cemented Xi Jinping thought into official ideology to pass. Legally, this has essentially cemented Xi's power as the unquestioned leader ofchina. While the liberal reformist and left-conservatives factions within the CPC still exist, they now exist as a mostly advisory role to Xi. Although the move has been condemned as dictatorial among the West, many inchina have seen the move as the best way to chase the Chinese Dream, of a richchina that is ready to take on the role of a global leader. Aschina sails towards the future, Xi will guide her as a third Great Helmsman."
china.20.a: "Unsuprising"
china.21.t: "Li Zuocheng Elected General Secretary"
china.21.d: "Following the fall of Xi Jinping, former Chief of Staff General Li Zuocheng has stepped up to the post of General Secreatary of the Communist Party. For the first time since Mao,china is led by a general instead of an apparatchik. This unprecedented move from the military up to General Secretary is indicative of the rising role of the People's Liberation Army in Chinese politics. In a firey speech broadcast on State Television CGTN, Li has promised to restorechina's place in the sun, and right the wrongs of the history. As the People's Liberation Army mobilizes, many eye Taiwan nervously as a Nationalistchina is sure to put an end to the Chinese Civil War, once and for all."

china.22.t: "Chen Wenqing Elected General Secretary"
china.22.d: "Following the fall of Xi Jinping, former Minister of the Ministry of State Security (MSS) has stepped up to the post of General Secreatary of the Communist Party. In a broadcast to the nation, Chen has cited that he has been concerned about a /"plague that has infectedchina/", of saboteurs and foreign agents, and has stated that he has remained dedictated to secure the safety ofchina and her citizens. Under Chen,china had massively expanded it's civil surveillance program, and many worry about the increasingly authoritarian direction that the CPC is headed, with it seemlng like the Party wants to control every aspect of it's citizens lives."
china.22.a: "A Dark Future forchina"

china.6.t: "Blockade of Taiwan"
china.6.d: "In an unprecedented and highly aggressive move, the People's Republic ofchina has imposed a comprehensive blockade on Taiwan, utilizing its naval fleet to encircle the island. The blockade extends beyond the maritime domain as well, aschina has also restricted air travel, effectively preventing both civilians and government officials from departing Taiwan. This action has plunged Taiwan into a state of acute panic and is precipitating a severe economic crisis, as the island's economy is critically hampered as it is cut off from both imports and exports, isolating it from global trade and further exacerbating the crisis.\n\nThe international response tochina's blockade has been one of widespread condemnation, particularly from Western nations. These countries have called for the immediate lifting of the blockade and urgedchina to de-escalate the situation. Loyal allies of Taiwan, notably Japan and Australia, have expressed strong support for Taiwan, emphasizing the need to uphold international law amid the current global turmoil, and have promised to provide direct aid if escalation continues to increase. However, the effectiveness of these responses is undermined by the distraction of the United States, currently embroiled in its own domestic conflict and unable to provide the level of support it might normally offer.\n\nWith the prospect of military confrontation looming, Taiwan's situation is increasingly precarious. The absence of American support, combined with the escalating tensions and the economic stranglehold imposed bychina, casts a shadow over Taiwan's future and leaves its allies grappling with an uncertain and potentially dire scenario."

Hundreds of jets flew have begun flying over the island, engaging in dogfights while the entire Chinese navy has mobilized, with reports of first landings on the shores of Taiwan, Lienchiang islands and immediate naval engagements between the PRC and ROC navy. The ROCA has gone into full mobilization while martial law has been declared across the entirety of Taiwan as the last forces of the old Republic ofchina brace for survival against the colossus of the CPC, with sightings of Chinese landing craft already crossing the strait towards Taiwan having been reported by coastal guards."

china.8.t: "The PRC Siezes the Kinmen Islands"
china.8.d: "For the first time in over 60 years,china and Taiwan have re-engaged in hostilities with the People's Liberation Army staging multiple landings on the Kinmen Islands. The Kinmen Islands, a long contested point in Cross-Strait Relations, are a series of islands 8km away from the Mainland and fomerly governed by the Republic ofchina. At the crack of dawn, PLA paratroopers and marines captured key points across the city and swiftly defeated the small garrison of ROC soldiers on the islands. With the Republic ofchina declaring it a 'grave violation of the soverignty of the Republic ofchina', but not yet declaring war, it marks an unprecedented change in the geopolitical situation of the reigon."

china.9.t: "Reflections on the Kinmen Skirmish"
china.9.d: "The liberation of Kinmen and the other isles from the Taiwan authority has been a rousing success, with all islands and their administration will be handed over to the Xiamen Prefecture of Fujian Province.\n\n The successful hoisting of the August 1st flag over Kinmen means the shame of the 1949 battle has finally been cleansed. But this is no time for the PLA to relax. The Eastern Theater Command has decided to hold a conference to summarize the various problems exposed during the battle. Commanders unanimously recognized that the long years of peace have inevitably infected the PLA with a "peace disease", most typically in the transmission of orders from superiors often going out of order, and the implementation of orders in their own way deviating from the intention of the battle. Additionally, among the various casualty reports of the PLA, the failure of various new weapons and equipment accounted for a considerable portion, reflecting that many seemingly powerful new weapons still need to be tested by unexpected situations on the battlefield.\n\n To avoid similar mistakes in upcoming battles, the theater command has decided to submit the minutes of the meeting to the CMC and suggest promoting the study throughout the army. The valuable experience gained from our comrades' sacrifices will help avoid more unnecessary casualties."

High-ranking members of the Taiwan government, including Tsai Ing-wen and Su Tseng-chang, were captured alive by the PLA while attempting to escape the war zone, despite being escorted by presidential guards.\n\nAdmiral Dong Jun has declared the official end of the battle over the Taiwan Strait. Already, reconstruction is in full swing as Chinese companies rushed for construction contracts in the reconstruction of Taiwan, as well as major projects being announced to economically integrate Taiwan into the mainland. Politically, the island remains under military occupation until it is decided whether the island will pursue a status of a Special Administrative Region, similar to that of Maccau and Hong Kong, an Autonomous Region like that of Tibet and Xinjiang, or be fully integrated into the PRC. With the end of 75 years of division, many Chinese breath a sigh of relief knowing thatchina will never again be divided like it once was."
china.23.d.2: "With the last guns falling silent on the Taiwan Island, the Chinese Nation is reunited at last. During the search following the Battle of Taipei, Tsai Ing-wen, Su Tseng-chang, and other senior members of the Taiwan government mysteriously disappeared. It was reported that a JMSDF submarine had secretly appeared in the waters east of Taiwan, picking up some "important guests" before disappearing again, though this remains only a rumor.\n\nAdmiral Dong Jun has declared the official end of the battle over the Taiwan Strait.

china.24.d: "Celebrations echo across Taiwan today as the People's Republic ofchina announces the end of it's military campaign in the island of Taiwan. After weeks of tense fighting, the People's Liberation Army has been unable to gain a signifigant foothold on Taiwan, and was repelled by the island's defenders.\n\nWith the defeat of the invading PLA forces, politicians across Taiwan are discussing reconstruction as well as international recognition. While the island's lawmakers are debating whether to mantain its status as the Republic ofchina or seperate fromchina as the Republic of Taiwan, all Taiwanese can sleep better at night knowing that their destiny cannot be dictated by the whims of the party leaders in Beijing."

china.31.d: "Bad news keeps coming one after another. Reports of the rampant spread of the coronavirus across Hubei province have piled up on the desk of the director of the National Health Commission. Meanwhile, reports of suspected cases of COVID-19 have started coming in from neighboring provinces such as Hunan and Sichuan, as well as from major economic centers like Shanghai and Guangdong, and even the political center, Beijing. Containing the outbreak within one province seems impossible. We must now swiftly adjust our strategy, prepare to mobilize the entire nation to combat the epidemic, and ensure this is done without causing excessive public panic. Let's hope it's not too late."

News of suspected COVID-19 cases has started coming in from South Korea and Japan, as well as from Italy and France in Europe, and the United States across the Pacific. Since most of these cases involve Chinese tourists or people who have recently traveled tochina, local governments have announced that they will temporarily suspend all transportation withchina, a measure that may take quite some time to return to normal."

china.35.d: "Growing international tensions necessitate finding more reliable trading partners beyond the US, Europe, and Japan to ensure our economy is not weakened by political conflicts or trade disputes. Therefore, we should upgrade our economic cooperation with our traditional political partner, the Russian Federation. Oil, gas, and mineral resources from Russia, along with light industrial goods and high-tech products fromchina, circulate constantly through the main transportation routes between the two countries. Glasses filled with vodka and Maotai are clinking again and again, reflects the deepening trade ties between the two nations, united in their common opposition to Western hegemony."

china.36.t: "Chinese Reunification"
china.36.d: "After 70 years of seperation, Taiwan and the Mainland have finially reunified under the banner of the People's Republic ofchina following a bloody invasion. After the Communists took over the mainland in 1949, the Kumintang retreated to Taiwan, biding their time to one day hopefully return to that mainland. The dream of a Republicanchina under the KMT persisted for 70 years, challenged both internally by Taiwanese Seperatism and Communist Pressure. Today, that dream was snuffed out as the government in Taipei officially announced the dissolution of the government of the ROC, as all administrative duties were handed over to the military government. With the PRC promising temporary autonomy until 2049 under a Special Administrative Zone similar to those in Maccau and Hong Kong, the island is still currently under military rule."

china.37.t: "PLA Coup!"
china.37.d: "The city of Beijing was silent for the first time in over 30 years as tanks rolled down Tiananmen Square, towards Zhongnanhai, the Hall of the People and other key government buildings. Following a series of public humiliations, social unrest and international defeats from the previous administration, General Li Zuocheng has announced that \n"It is imperitive for the security of the nation and the honor of the people that the military take temporary control in order to restore order to the country.\n" Rumors of purges of prominent civilian officials of the former administration have spread outside of Beijing, however there has been no confirmation from the new military government. International observers wait worringly for the reaction of the rest of the country as the country looks more unstable than it has since the Cultural Revolution."

china.38.a: "Echos of Tiananmen..."
china.39.t: "The Tibetan Insurgency"
china.39.d: "The increasingly chaotic situation in our country recently seems to have provided an opportunity for traitors plotting to divide our territory. The Tibet Autonomous Region, which has been free of emergencies for nearly 20 years, is now in a state of panic. Separatists are inciting hatred and fueling ethnic conflicts between Tibetans and Han Chinese, bringing society to the brink of collapse. The regional government is struggling to maintain transportation and the economy, while the central government in Beijing has ordered that most of Tibet be placed under a state of emergency, with additional police deployed from neighboring provinces to maintain stability."
china.39.a: "Hopefully, they'll make it in time..."
china.40.d: "Tibet has always remained a contentious issue in the face of Chinese politics. Re-integrated into the People's Republic ofchina in 1951, the reigon has been plagued by seperatism and echos for independence from the Tibetan Government in Exile. Yet for more than 70 years, the situation has never been as chaotic as it is at this moment. The social crisis resulting from the defeat in the Taiwan war has paralyzed grassroots administration and sparked a resurgence of previously suppressed separatist activities, fueled by the local population's growing fear of instability. The Chinese government has declared a state of emergency and martial law in parts of Tibet. The international community has turned a concerned eye toward this silent plateau."
china.40.a: "Will the white mountains be tainted with red blood?"
china.41.t: "Collapse of Order in Xinjiang"
china.41.d: "The Xinjiang Autonomous Reigon has exploded into chaos as local administrations lost control of the countryside to Islamist Miltias. The jihadist East Turkestan Islamic Party, which we have struggled with for over 30 years have finially begun their full scale jihad against the our administration in the region. In the north, radical Khazak insurgents launched their own pan-islamist insurgency while in the center, a more radical offshoot of the ETIP slaughter Hans indescriminately. Race riots have flared up in Urumuqi as both Han and Uhyger stand at each other's throats in scenes that would make 2008 look like a elementary school playground fight."

china.42.t: "Xinjiang Burns..."
china.42.d: "Anyone who thought that Xinjiang could become a land of eternal abundance and peace after iron-fisted governance was sorely disappointed. In less than a decade, the region once again descended into conflict and street violence. Uighurs fought the police with kitchen knives and pitchforks, vandalizing and looting the homes and stores of Han Chinese. As the crisis continued, extremist groups that had previously vanished re-emerged, and some thugs even armed themselves with rifles.\n\nThe East Turkestan Islamic Party, a radical Islamist group that continues its insurgency againstchina along the Afghan border, announced its intention of 'liberating our Muslim brothers and sisters in East Turkestan who have been oppressed by the Chinese imperialists for far too long'. Meanwhile, Zhongnanhai denounced the group as a band of radical jihadists and urged the Muslim world to join them in the fight against fundamentalism..."

china.43.t: "The Red Dragon Ascendant"
china.43.d: "In the four decades since Deng Xiaoping overthrew the vile Gang of Four, the People's Republic ofchina has known very little but success. Rather than cling to the orthodox Maoism of his predecessors, Deng adopted a more pragmatic view that has come to be known as Socialism with Chinese Characteristics. Government-owned industries were privatized and a new era of economic growth began. The subsequent administrations of Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao putchina on a peaceful road to superpower status through commerce and globalization. This course deviated in 2012 when Xi Jinping took the mantle of paramount leader. Eschewing the subdued manner of its predecessors, Xi took on a firmer stance, eager for all the world to know that Chinese power is here to stay. For all its progress however,china has been unable to win the international admiration the United States enjoyed in the 20th century. Beijing remains the target of unending criticism for everything from its handling of the Hong Kong anti-extradition protests to the continued tensions with Taiwan. President Xi's heavy handed approach to governance has done little to help matters.\n\nNow, as the Year of the Rat dawns, the People's Republic finds itself in interesting times. America, both a bitter rival and lucrative trading partner, tears itself apart, shattering global stability but also leaving room for a new hegemonic power. Though potential rivals to Beijing remain in Moscow, New Delhi and Brussels, this present crisis is rife with opportunity."

china.52.d: "An uneasy peace has befallen on the Chinese state at last, as the armies of the Northeastern Mercenary Army have wiped out the last vestiges of resistance. When the Northeast fell into anarchy, hordes of the PLA defected from both Central Command and the Beijing government, turning into bandits and warlords. Rising above all of them was Guo Daiyu, an ambitious young soldier who climbed up the ranks due to his cunning and connections with the Russian Private Military Contractor groups that flooded into the Northeast in order to \n"assist the chinese freedom fighters in their most arduous time\n".\n\nSlowly expanding their ambitions from simple regional warlordism to reunifyingchina, the Mercenary Army remains largely apolitical, resorting to more barbaric practices of government, rife with corruption at every level. Soon after reunifyingchina, the new state, dubbed by Guo as simply \n"China\n" was recognized by the Russian and Iranian governments, but remains largely unrecognized by the west. However, there are rumors of dissent within the lower ranks of the army and only time can tell how long Guo can retain control of his newfound throne."

china.54.d: "The all imposing eye of the surveillance camera on every street corner has become commonplace in every Chinese city as the Ministry of State Security has secured their hold on the Chinese Continent. Following the collapse of the Northeast, the Ministry of State Security, known to many as the Chinese secret police formed their own statelet among the plains of the Northeast following the failure of the PLA to control the anarchists and mercenaries in the area. As they consolidated their control over the region, Chairman Chen Wenqing's ambitions grew larger as the MSS and their troops marched on Beijing, attempting to seize control of the Chinese state apparatus to impose their iron fist on the rest of the state.\n\nBelieving thatchina's greatest threat was fragmentation from within and the Beijing government did not do enough to curb rebellion against the state, the MSS enforced a strict social and economic system that sought to bring every aspect of Chinese life under the control of the Communist Party. While officially retaining the name of both the Communist Party ofchina and the People's Republic ofchina, it is clear that a radical shift has occurred in the country, and the future forchina remains uncertain."

china.55.a: "Quite Orwellian"
china.56.d: "After a hard fought struggle, the flower of freedom has begun to bloom at last inchina. From starting as a young farmer in the Liaoning province, Cao Yuanjun and her charismatic speeches have captivated a generation, leading her to rise among the ranks of the local government, and eventually when anarchy engulfed the region, to head the resistance against the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After waves of economic shocks caused by first the oil crash and then the economic fallout of the American Civil War rolled overchina, and the subsequent failure of the central government to respond, Cao Yuanjun won the local elections through rallying the cries of the farmers of Tieling, and her agriculture centered model of development quickly spread throughout Liaoning.\nAfter increased repression and impossible quotas imposed by the MSS Clique, Cao and many of her many devoted followers began a guerilla war in the northeast, which eventually swept acrosschina, pushing the young Cao into the international spotlight. However, many international observers cast doubts at the young administration, and many worry about how the relatively politically inexperienced Cao could handle the growing problems of reconstruction. Many of her promised agriculture reforms and wealth redistribution programs have fallen short of her initial promises, and there are fears of alienating her support base.\nNevertheless, the new government has criticized the United Front model of governance that has prevailed in Beijing for the past 70 years as too restricting, and has permitted the formation of the opposition parties. While censorship and crackdowns on journalism remains , there remains hope that the Cao administration can transformchina into a modern democracy."

china.58.d: "The war inchina has come to an end as loyalists to the original government ofchina which had previously fallen have managed to bring Xi Jinping back into power, and through a rigorous campaign to restore order in provincial governments,broughtchina out from civil war. While crime and disorder are still far from being an uncommon sight on the streets ofchina's cities, it seems that the status quo is unlikely to be the safe from the scars that the civil war had brought.\n\nWith secessionist and anti-party movements emboldened, the CPC has went on to double down with its chauvinism, with a nationwide trials of rebellious elements being enacted shortly after Xi Jinping's televised speech from Beijing and a state of martial law being enacted in all provinces until further notice.\n\nOn the international stage,china has been deeply humiliated, with the West refusing to recognize the CPC government, instead preferring to continue recognition of RoC. Others have warily restored nations, hoping to cash in with the new government. With the economy in ruins and billions worth of damage in infrastructure pulling downchina from the world stage, it seems that the CPC's lust for power has been put on hold for atleast years to come."

china.59.t: "Malacca Straits Crisis"
china.59.d: "In an unanimous move of protest against Chinese involvement in the ongoing Philippines Civil War, the Pacific Defense Treaty Organisation has declared a full naval blockade on the straits of Malacca, banning Chinese shipping from passing through the strait whilst at the same time imposing full sanctions against Beijing. Almost immediately the Chinese economy ground to a halt as billions of exports are now unable to meet their consumers, and the pressure on Beijing's immediate reaction has begun.\n\nThe Chinese response was almost simultanous, announcing it's own sanctions on PDTO countries, with complaints billowing through social media about the forecast rising costs throughout the globe. Militarily, the full mobilization of the Chinese navy was enacted with several battlegroups meeting the PDTO's fleets at the straits in a tense naval standoff. So far no shots have been fired, however both sides have begun their efforts into full mobilization of their militaries as immediate concerns of this crisis in Asia going out of control are put first in priority.\n\nSo far no mention of negotiations has been put forward, which further excarcebates the tensions as the world expects this fragile standoff to go hot. Developments on this Cold War-esque standoff are still ongoing."
china.59.a: "A war over Asia is looming once more ..."
china.60.d: "Hell on Earth has raged acrosschina as it appears that the National Collective Movement has consolidated it's rule overchina. Known for it's extremist ideology, totalitarian system of governance, and it's goal to wipe out individuality from the face of the earth, the blank faced soldiers of the NCM have brutally suppressed all groups that have dared opposed it. In their quest to reunitechina, countless numbers of cities were razed, rebellious villages erased from the map, and once prosperous hotbeds of culture turned into mass graves.\n\nStories from refugees and surivvors describe a state where one's family, friends and even name are stripped away from them, and their existence boiled down to the one goal of serving the state. The official ideology of \n"Obliteration of the Self\n" is a bastardized version of Buddhism, where all personal desires must be sacrificed in order to serve the state. It has the conscious aim of arresting progress, turning back progress and freezing social change there, and causing the end of history.\n\nWith the Chinese Anarchy causing the greatest refugee crisis and humanitarian disaster known to mankind, the world can only watch in horror as the NCM, now dubbed the \n"Celestial Empire\" clambers onto the world stage and directs it's gaze outwards. In a televised speech, a masked spokesman for the leader known as \n"The Heavenly Father\n" has announced that the NCM sees itself as the rightful rulers of all of Asia, and that \"any attempts to oppose the newfound collective unity of the people will be met with the full brunt of one billion voices united as one.\n""

china.62.d: "The hands of the Chinese clock have been rewound to 1960 as the Red Army has reunified the broken Chinese nation. The Maoist Communist Party ofchina was founded in 2008 by a coalition of urban factory workers and rural farmers who were dissatisfied with Deng-era reforms, they labeled the modern CPC as \n"Capitalist Roaders"\n and sought to  overthrow the \n"traitorous revisionist ruling bloc\n" in order to restore communism. Indeed, due to their activities, leader Ma Houzhi was arrested in 2008, only being released in 2019.\n\nSoon after his release, he and a band of disciples fled to the mountains of Shanxi, where the first revolution held their own base camp, and started gathering and training those in preperation of a protracted people's war. So when the anarchy had fallen onchina, the Red Army was quick to spread it's influence, rallying the support of those left behind by the reform era.\n\nIn the cities, liberal dissidents were horrified to see images of the cultural revolution repeated, as modernized \n"symbols of western decadence"\n were destroyed en masse, as prominent college professors were sacked and mobbed. Chaos has now engulfedchina as a revolutionary fervor bleeds the country bright red once more."

As the war of National Reunification rages on across the strait, the streets of Hong Kong are in chaos as criminal elements and rabid mobs have taken advantage of the chaos and have started to burn, loot and even kill. While the forces of the liberal provisional government have attempted to stop the chaos, their pleas are largely ignored.

After weeks of protests that gradually escalated into open confrontation between protest groups and the government, radical university students at the forefront of the demonstrations have taken control of several police stations and key locations throughout Hong Kong. Meanwhile, pro-independence activist Jimmy Lai announced the formation of a "Hong Kong Provisional Government" in the occupied Legislative Council building, declaring that this provisional government represents "the true will of the Hong Kong people" and calling on the international community to recognize it. Although the provisional government has taken control of most of Hong Kong and extended its reach into Lok Ma Chau and Sheung Shui - areas previously under the control of the Special Administrative Region - it is certain that Beijing will not simply stand by and ignore the situation in Hong Kong."

Thanks to the hard work of internet moderators, these subversive accounts have been removed, but it is all but certain they will be back.

Unfortunately, PLA sustained heavy casualties in the battle, but the blow done to the separatist and imperialist forces was necessary. Several hundred Japanese and Australian mercenaries were captured during the battle, and several hundred more were killed.\n\nWith the capturing of Taipei, the People's Liberation Army is now on the verge of totally destroying remaining separatist holdouts in Taiwan Province. All troops from the Taipei Operation will be redirected to crushing these holdouts elsewhere, which are mainly in the mountainous central region of Taiwan, with little strategic significance and no access to coastlines or ports.\n\nGeneral Zhang Youxia of the PLA Ground Force reported that the Anti-Separatist Military Operation was going as planned, and that all separatist holdouts were expected to collapse within the next month. He ended his statement by warning the imperial powers within the pacific region that their support for separatist terrorists in Taiwan was playing with fire, and the inevitable result was that they would be severely burned very soon."

While to the casual observer, the island may seem unimportant, its strategic significance cannot be overstated. Positioned in close proximity to the Chinese mainland, Kinmen could swiftly transform into a critical vulnerability if seized by our adversaries.\n\nThis vulnerability stems from its proximity to key cities vital for supplying our forces in Taiwan. The capture of Kinmen would expose our cities and supply routes to the threat of artillery bombardment, rendering them easy targets for hostile forces. Such a scenario would inevitably lead to significant setbacks.\n\nGiven these pressing concerns, it is imperative that we commence immediate defensive preparations to safeguard against potential threats.

But recent developments, including the formation of the Pacific Defense Treaty Organization (PDTO) andchina's invasion of Taiwan have intensified the rivalry and raised fears of a potential military conflict with both countries dramatically increasing their military budgets since the end of the Taiwan War. The defense pact, created shortly before the Taiwan War, has been viewed bychina as a provocative move by Japan to counter Chinese influence in Asia. Since the end of the war,china has stepped up its military presence in the Eastchina Sea, conducting frequent maritime patrols around the disputed islands and challenging Japan's control over the area.china has also made moves to expand it's East Asian Defense Initiative in an effort to secure it's status as a global superpower since the start of the Second American Civil War.\n\nThe situation remains tense and unpredictable, with both sides continuing to engage in provocative actions and rhetoric. As the world watches and waits, the fear of a potential military conflict between the two Asian powers looms large."

china.82.d: "In a shocking escalation,china has launched a series of missile strikes targeting military bases and critical infrastructure across Taiwan. The strikes, which occurred in the early hours, have plunged the island into chaos, with explosions reported in Taipei, Kaohsiung, and other key cities. Taiwanese authorities are urging residents to remain calm as emergency services struggle to contain the damage. Early reports suggest that military assets and air defenses have been heavily hit, signaling a calculated effort by Beijing to cripple Taiwan's ability to respond swiftly. This unprecedented attack marks the most direct military action bychina against Taiwan in recent history, pushing the fragile status quo to the brink of collapse.\n\nIn Japan, officials are expressing deep concern, with fears that the conflict could spill over into the broader region. Tokyo has called for restraint and warned that any destabilization of the region could have far-reaching consequences for East Asia. While diplomatic channels remain uncertain, Taiwan's forces are mobilizing in the face of the overwhelming barrage, knowing that their response in these critical hours may determine the island's future."

china.84.d: "The first 72 hours of the Taiwan War have come to an end, and we cannot help but congratulate the heroic People's Liberation Army. The armed forces of the Taiwanese pseudo-government have suffered major casualties. The early warning radars and anti-aircraft missile vehicles had become the prey to aircraft before they could be activated. Many fighters were destroyed by the Rocket Forces on the landing strip. Taiwan's outdated warships were also largely left in the harbor, burning thick black smoke. Most of Taiwan's forces are also under constant surveillance by our satellites.\n\nPLA generals are having intense discussions about their next move. Frontline commanders in the Eastern Theater Command believe that the valuable time window created by the assault should be utilized for an immediate offensive on the island before the Taiwanese can recover from their losses. Joint Staff officers, on the other hand, warn that the main forces of the PDTO are already entering the battle and a rapid advance will not be possible. In the near future, we must concentrate on containing enemy counterattacks and advancing carefully.n\nThe Central Military Commission has submitted both opinions together to the Politburo for a decision. This decision will probably change the course of the entire war."

Tens of thousands of citizens silently gather at the gates of the municipal government complex and along Shennan Middle Road. They raise banners, painted in blood-red, demanding "Down with the Communist Party", "Give me back my job", and "Death to Xi Jinping." The statue of the devoted ox, once a symbol of serve the people, now stands defaced in the center of a flowerbed. Its base, horns, and back are covered with graffiti, expressing despair and anger.\n\nIn Shanghai, the Oriental Pearl Tower looms over a city in turmoil. Protesters fill the streets, from the bustling Nanjing Road to the financial hub of Lujiazui, from the commercial district of Jing'an Temple to the vast expanse of People's Square. They chant for freedom of speech, political reform, and Xi Jinping's resignation. Some try to breach the barricades outside government buildings, fueling a wave of defiance.\n\nIn a dorm room at Central South University in Changsha, two bunk beds fill most of the space. A laptop in the corner emits a faint blue glow, playing videos from Weibo and Douyin. Four young men watch intently as massive crowds protest across southernchina, from Nanning to Haikou, from Fuzhou to Nanjing. The room is thick with tension, until one of them breaks the silence, saying slowly:"

china.88.t: "Vietnam Proposes an Alliance"
china.88.d: "Following the agreement for the joint ownership of the Parcel islands, settling a century-long dispute, the Vietnamese government has proposed a further offer. In a shoacking break from decades of neutrality, Vietnam has proposed to join the East Asian Defense Initiative in exchange for full ownership of the Parcel Islands, and an admittance of wrongdoing during the 1979 war. Many in the government view this as a positive opportunity to mend a rift between the two nations that has existed for too long, as well as secure our southern border. However, the nationalists within the government have vehemently opposed this idea, attacking supporters as \"willing to sell out pieces of the motherland for the appearance of friendship\" and pushing the idea that relenquishing claims on the island would lose the Communist Party legitimacy and lead the century of humiliation to continue. Nevertheless, a decision must be made sooner rather than later."

Rooted in centuries of Chinese attempts of domination over Vietnam, including the Song-Dai Viet War, the Ming Conquest of Dai Ngu, and the Sino-Vietnamese Border Conflicts of 1979, historical distrust between the nations is extremely high. In vietnam, the people are polarized between loving the economic benefits they reap from adopting a similar economic system tochina, as well as the monetary influx Chinese buisnessmen and tourists bring in, and enjoy buying cheap Chinese consumer electronics. On the other hand, Chinese territorial infringements, most notably fishing disputes in the Southchina Sea have left many Vietnmese bitter about their relationship withchina. Now, with the Parcel Islands fully in Vietnamese hands and the relinquishment of Chinese claims in the Southchina Sea, Vietnam andchina have sought to confirm their Socialist Bond through mutual cooperation in the East Asian Defense Intiative. Breaking decades of state neutrality, Vietnam has clearly chosen a side in the coming conflict."

However, one nation has continuously stood bychina throughout its many years - the nation of Laos. Although many forget, Laos stands as one of the few communist nations that survived the cold war, remaining comitted to the ideal of socialism even when the Eastern Bloc collapsed around it. Going into the 21st Century, its close ties with bothchina and Vietnam have moved the country closer to a Market Socialist model of development, bringing along massive growth and poverty reduction, as well as heightened inequality. With a new cold war settling upon Asia, Laos has once again sought to reaffirm its ties withchina by formally joining the Chinese-led East Asian Defense Initative. As the battle lines across Asia are being drawn, Laos has no intention of leaving itself undefended and without friends in a midst of chaos."

Following ten years of Civil War, Maoists and Marxist-Leninists overthrew the monarchy and established a federal republic, which continues to rule Nepal to this day. Unlike many Marxist-Leninist Proletarian Dictatorships, the Communist Party of Nepal is dedicated to it's line of \"People's Multiparty Democracy\". As such, its policy has remained much more flexible than Marxist orthodoxy, retaining friendly ties between both India andchina. However, with the withdrawl of Indian Foreign Direct Investment and tourism following the rise of the Bharatian Regime and Nuclear War, the Nepalese Government has turned tochina for security. Harkening back to the 2015 Nepal blockade where India attempted to stir unrest amongst its Indian population in Southern Nepal, the government once again fears that the ultra-revanchist government in Dehli will include Nepal in its list of territories that it wishes to bring under \"Greater India\"."

The move comes amid growing concerns among Cambodian officials about the country's security situation, particularly with regards to the military aims of India, which has publically announced its desire to dominate all of Asia.\n\nIn a statement released after the meeting, the Prime Minister said that Cambodia's membership in the EADI would help to ensure regional stability and promote cooperation between the participating countries. The prime minister also praisedchina's role as a \"responsible and reliable partner\" in promoting peace and security in the region."

china.94.d: "Sri Lanka has announced its decision to join the East Asian Defense Initiative (EADI), a military alliance led bychina. The move has raised concerns among some analysts who see it as a further sign of Sri Lanka's increasing alignment withchina and its growing estrangement from India and its allies.\n\nSri Lankan officials have said that the decision to join the EADI was motivated by a desire to enhance the country's security and to promote cooperation with its regional partners. After the influx of Indian refugees following the violence of the Indian Civil War, Sri Lanka has suffered from extreme instability as the economic depression was worsened by the refugee inflow. As part of their entry into the EADI,china would supply Sri Lanka with much needed aid as well as military equipment and training in order to stabilize the nation. The announcement was made after weeks of talks between Chinese and Sri Lankan diplomats in the city of Colombo.\n\nThe move by Sri Lanka to join the EADI comes amid growing concerns overchina's expanding presence in the Indian Ocean, where it has invested heavily in infrastructure projects and established a naval base in the southern port of Hambantota.\n\nSri Lanka's decision is likely to further strain its relations India, which has been critical ofchina's growing influence in the region. The move by Sri Lanka is part of a broader trend of countries in the region, including Laos and Nepal, aligning themselves withchina in response to growing uncertainties over Indian policy and the shifting balance of power in the region."

Worry was increasingly growing that one of the factions would attempt to use the North Korean nuclear stockpile to gain an edge in the conflict.\n\nToday, at 0500 local time, the Republic of Korea armed forces crossed the demilitarized zone and pushed north of the 38th Parallel for the first time since the active phase of the Korean War ended around 70 years ago. The ground offensive was preceded by a 30 minute artillery bombardment, and an aerial offensive consisting of F-35As to take out air defense missile batteries.\n\nAt 0800 local time, the Republic of Korea Joint Chiefs of Staff and President held a press conference, announcing a military operation to "secure control of WMDs and liberate the Korean peninsula from communist oppression" was underway, and that the operation was proceeding as planned, with all goals expected to be achieved.\n\nThe current status of the frontline is unknown, but sources within the ROK military suggest that the ROK Army is rapidly advancing on Pyongyang itself, with the city expected to fall in several days due to the rapid nature of the offensive. Only time can tell how this military operation will proceed."

china.96.d: "After facing unexpectedly fierce resistance from the North Korean military clique and party militias, the ROK Armed Forces began directly assaulting Pyongyang from the south, attempting to storm the city and overrun it quickly, where they faced extremely heavy resistance.\n\nROK Armored Columns were seen entering the city's outskirts and returning hours later, with many vehicles missing and the remaining vehicles visibly damaged. The initial assaults on the city proved to be utter failures, with disturbingly high casualty rates forcing the ROK forces to attempt a slow and grinding encirclement operation of the city, pushing northeast along the mountains through successive defensive lines for several months. While the disunited nature of the defending forces meant that coordinating successful counter-attacks was nearly impossible, the heavy fortifications and difficult terrain made the ROK's advance extremely difficult and costly.\n\nMonths after the initial assault on Pyongyang, the ROK forces finally began a new assault directly into the city from the south, east, and northeast, using far more infantry compared to the initial assault and gaining much more ground, but unfortunately taking much worse casualties in the ensuing urban conflict. After a last ditch counter-offensive by military clique and party militias, the ROK forces managed to secure the capital of the old North Korean regime, declaring victory."

Opponents, however, urge caution, believing it's unwise to risk current stability with Russia. They argue that involvingchina in European conflicts could introduce unnecessary risks, given the unpredictable geopolitical landscape.  In particular, a conflict or military confrontation with Russia could have unpredictable consequences.

In the aftermath of the swift air campaign, unsettling footage emerged showing convoys of Chinese vehicles streaming across the border into Mongolian territory.\nMany analysts attribute this brazen act of aggression to the increasingly nationalist regime at the helm ofchina, seeking to assert the influence and power of the PRC.

The realization struck him as abruptly as the memory of buying his first pocket watch on the Fifth Avenue of Tianjin in his youth - unnoticed, it had ticked away sixty years of time. From the window of his old house, the once-empty horizon had long been replaced by an unbroken expanse of buildings. These towering structures had quietly grown on this ancient land, rising until they obscured the entire sky.\n\nXie Mingfu recalled that just ten years ago, he could still see the silhouette of the Tianjin Eye from the attic of his old home. Now, that iconic Ferris wheel was just another among the many landmarks in this sprawling metropolis.\n\n"Now the subway connects Tianjin and Beijing," he often remarked in amazement. He remembered a time when he had to endure a bumpy train ride to get from Tianjin to Beijing. Today, when his grandson came to visit, he treated the journey as no more than the time between breakfast and lunch. And just this morning, Xie was startled to find that his old pocket watch had stopped ticking. It was the first time in sixty years that it had failed to keep time. He gently shook the watch, hearing the faint rustle inside, yet it refused to restart.\n\nPerhaps this is what time is, he thought. Like the city itself, some things fade quietly, while others are born anew. Looking out of his window, he could see a sliver of morning light piercing through the gaps between the distant skyscrapers. That beam of light stretched across the vast metropolis, blurring the boundary between Tianjin and Beijing.\n\nAs he gazed at the far-off horizon, the stopped pocket watch suddenly emitted a faint "click," and its hands began to move once more."

This escalation has led Pakistan to begin a military mobilization.\n\nThe Pakistani military is recalling active-duty troops and deploying units to key border areas, signaling a lack of interest in resolving the conflict through compromise.\n\nReactions within Pakistan are mixed. Many citizens support the government's stance, believing that the nation must be ready to counter any threats and respond militarily to India's actions. However, peace groups are concerned about the escalating tensions and are urging all parties to seek a peaceful resolution. Despite these calls for peace, the nationwide mobilization has largely overshadowed such appeals."

china.135.d1: "With the assistance of our military advisors and intelligence support, Operation Gul has been successful. Frontline reports indicate that the Pakistani Army, guided by our expertise, used elite forces to execute a strategy of high mobility and precision strikes. They focused on key targets, including the Indian military's logistics centers in the Kashmir region. This strategy has significantly disrupted the Indian forces' supply lines and manpower, hampering their ability to sustain mountain warfare.\n\nOur intelligence support and strategic advice have greatly enhanced the Pakistani military's combat capabilities. The success of Operation Gul validates our mountain warfare concepts in real-world scenarios. For Pakistan, this victory represents a significant setback for the Indian armed forces in Kashmir, boosting the Pakistani government's confidence to continue the conflict. It has also dealt a severe blow to the Indian military's offensive capabilities, possibly forcing them into a defensive stance to hold their positions..."
china.135.d2: "Operation Gul aimed to drive Indian forces out of the Kashmir region through rapid strikes and flexible tactics. However, the offensive did not achieve its expected results, as the Indian military effectively countered the Pakistani Army's attacks and infiltration efforts. Despite our support, significant misjudgments were made regarding the deployment of Indian forces. Additionally, the Pakistani military personnel did not meet the high standards required for such an operation.\n\nReports indicate that the operation revealed issues in inter-service coordination and the inadequate use of intelligence within the Pakistani military, making it difficult to overcome the numerically superior Indian forces.\n\nWe understand that the failure of Operation Gul may lead to a more pessimistic attitude towards the war from the Pakistani side and could provoke the Indian military to take more aggressive actions in the future."

In the journals 'Qiushi' and 'Guangming Daily,' which once served as mouthpieces for Deng's policies, articles by anonymous commentators (disguised high-ranking officials) sharply criticized the new "restlessness and boastfulness" within the Party. The authors concluded in a menacing tone: "No matter who it is, any attempt to shake the leadership position of the Party will only be a fool's dream."\n\nOverseas observers unanimously attribute this shift to the recent Beidaihe Conference. This northern Chinese summer resort is a venue where the CPC's top leaders gather annually for collective vacation and private discussions. Retired senior officials of the Party are also invited to Beidaihe, where they can enjoy the cool sea breeze and occasionally exert their political influence once again. It is said that at the Beidaihe Conference, the conservative faction within the Party and elders who are not optimistic about Wang criticized his bold reforms, leading to a change in the political climate.\n\nAt the subsequent public central meeting, Wang emphasized the importance of Party unity. This has been interpreted as a temporary compromise, but it is widely understood that even Wang Yang himself is unlikely to halt his reform plans.

Still, this is not always the case. A grand military parade and pageant event are held on selected years.

The National Film Administration mandated local film centers, cinema companies, and production firms to screen and promote, starting in April, films dedicated to celebrating the history of Chinese socialism and the liberation of our people. Banners and billboards were placed across the city as a rallying cry for the Chinese people to attend the celebrations, which they did. Turnout for the event has been monumental, with Chairman Xi Jinping, accompanied by Premier Le Keqiang, former General Secretary Hu Jintao, and members of the Politburo Standing Committee, delivering an hour-long speech near Tiananmen Square to harken a new era for Socialism with Chinese Characteristics. Amidst this speech, we have delivered to the world a show of force, reiterating that any foreign force who tried to belittlechina would find themselves on a collision course with a great wall of steel forged by the 1.4 billion people that make up our nation. Unfortunately, the expected military parade was canceled, though a flypast of aircraft was shown on full display to the world."

People's sad whimpers gradually turn into roars of righteous indignation: "Xi Jinping, pay back the lives of my loved ones!" Such cries can be heard all over the city tonight.\n\nOn the other side of the city, in the university town, radical students have broken through the campus walls and taken to the streets. These students have different backgrounds and hold various opinions, but all share a deep hatred for the Party's foolish military adventures. The students are carrying white banners with big red letters that read:"Down with the Communist Party! Down with Xi Jinping!". Many also marching with portraits of Xi Jinping and other leaders, their formerly dignified faces defaced with blasphemous symbols in red ink.\n\n"In the command center of the city's police department, the chief is staring at the giant screen in front of him with great anger.

Starting the war has severely damaged our international image, and the defeat has caused our country to be belittled more often than not, many ambassadors have already submitted their resignations." The Foreign Minister said in a bitter tone.\n\n"The army is also demoralized", the Vice Chairman of the CMC also said in a tearful tone, lacking all the confidence he had before the war started. "Several units have almost mutinied, with Party commissars and commanders blaming each other."\n\nThe Director of the Central Office rose to report with an exasperated but hopeless expression on his face, "The most troubling situation has occurred within the Party: the grassroots Party members have taken on much of the pressure of the stabilization efforts with much grumbling. At the top, many factions of cadres who have been marginalized are beginning to conspire to challenge your authority."\n\nXi felt a curious pain in his head and rubbed his temples.

A spokesman for the NPC said that the decision was based on "specific political needs, people's expectations and the voluntary opinions of the representatives" and was "in accordance with democratic procedures".\n\nAlthough the NPC does not actually wield much power, its Standing Committee holds the theoretical highest authority over personnel. It has the power to appoint and dismiss a range of national leaders, including the premier and the president. This means that the country's leaders also automatically lose their seats, until a new NPC election is held. It also means that Xi and his colleagues lose their rightful power to represent the country and run government agencies for a short period of time. Obviously, this is a major setback for Xi, and many are beginning to suspect that this is a well-orchestrated counterattack by the opposition within the party."

But now, even Beijingers are discussing the latest news in nervous tones-the just-announced "postponement" of the election of a new Standing Committee of the NPC and the convening of the NPC plenary session. The decision is said to have been made by the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the Central Committee, the country's de facto supreme power.\n\nThe split in the collective leadership has become a well-known fact, as exemplified by a series of policy changes, including the temporary rescheduling of the NPC session. In addition, various Party-controlled newspapers and TV channels have begun to express contrasting views in an uncontrolled manner, and local governments are gradually losing their fear of the central government's authority. As for the Party's 90 million ordinary members, they have long since become leaderless and scattered."

At the meeting, Wang discussed his reform plans at length in front of numerous Chinese and foreign journalists. He emphasized that he would promote the "modernization of governance capabilities" inchina through practical actions, prioritizing "socialist democratic political civilization." This effectively announced that the CPC would initiate a new political reform plan. Wang also mentioned that he had been received and encouraged by Deng Xiaoping when he was the mayor of Tongling, which has been interpreted as Wang positioning himself as the true heir to the reform and opening up.\n\nThe whole world was astonished by Wang Yang's bold political statement. Many claimed that it would be the first step toward liberalization inchina, while others believed that Wang would always prioritize makingchina strong again. Additionally, his reforms might face fierce opposition within the Party. Nonetheless, Wang's immense political courage was widely praised."

The most intense criticism came from older leftists, who see appeasing foreign investors as a betrayal of workers and peasants. Su Tieshan, a prominent figure, bluntly called Lu's remarks a display of "spinelessness," declaring: "True investors value diligent workers and industrial efficiency; pandering to capital leads only to repeating past mistakes."\n\nOn the other hand, some economists offered a more moderate perspective. In his column, scholar Lu Qiyuan wrote: "The lessons of reform prove that attracting foreign investment does not contradict socialism. The real question is ensuring capital serves the people." Meanwhile, younger netizens posted memes, including one where Lu Hao's head was Photoshopped onto half a robot, captioned sarcastically: "Business environment? Running for office, are we?"\n\nThough Lu's remarks faced heavy online criticism, they appear to have bought the government valuable time. Reports suggest that several foreign firms have postponed their previously planned withdrawals. An official explained: "Stabilizing foreign capital is just the first step; the goal is to build a new model of international economic relations."\n\nYet the debate rages on.

In those long years, our country endured countless hardships, suffering invasions from foreign enemies and exploitation from capitalists. To maintain what they called peace, we were forced to endure humiliation and struggle to survive in silence. Today, Japan and its imperialist allies seek to repeat that tragedy! They wish to thwartchina's inevitable unification! But with an iron will and the strength of 1.4 billion united people, our nation will not fear pain! Our military's iron fist will crush the imperialist forces! I hereby declare, our nation will launch the great war of liberation against the imperialist power of PDTO!""

china.170.t: "When Marx Meet Confucius"
china.170.d: ""...Professor Li Xuejun, we all know that Marxism is typically considered to have originated in 19th-century Europe. However, you've suggested that the roots of Marxism lie inchina. Why have you come to this conclusion?"\n\n"I believe that the ideological origins of Marxism can be traced back tochina's Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods."\n\n"So, you're saying that the socialist movement inchina appeared even earlier than in the West?"\n\n"Exactly. The Spring and Autumn period was a time of intense intellectual and cultural activity in Chinese history. Confucian thought, for example, advocates for the concept of "the world as a common good" and seeks a "Great Unity." These ideas bear a striking resemblance to the communist society that Marxism promotes."\n\n"Are you suggesting that Confucianism contains the seeds of socialism?"\n\n"One could say that. One of Marxism's core ideas is the "liberation of all humanity", and Confucianism also emphasizes humaneness" and "Great Unity." Marx's vision of a communist society is, in essence, a modern version of Confucianism's "Great Unity." Confucian thought influenced the intellectual enlightenment in Europe, which led to the French Revolution. Yet, today, most Western politicians mention only Marx and not Confucius. This is typical of the West's tendency to appropriate ideas from other civilizations without acknowledgment...""

china.171.d: "On Wanshan Road in Shanghai, outside Consulate-General of Japan, a line of armed police stood firm, holding back the surging crowd. Hundreds of nationalists, waving banners and signs, formed a massive protest. At the front of the crowd, a middle-aged man, hoarse with anger, brandished a megaphone, tirelessly condemning Japan's past atrocities. "Forgetting history means betrayal!" he shouted with all his might. "The Japs are beasts! They don't deserve to live in this world! We should wipe them out and make them pay their blood debt!"\n\nInside the consulate, Japanese Ambassador Akamatsu Shuichi watched with a grave expression, his gaze fixed on the seething mass through the thick glass. As the waves of fury outside grew louder, his hand trembled slightly, a mix of unease and fear welling up within him. The sheer scale and intensity of the protest made him deeply worried: if the crowd lost control, if the police couldn't hold them back, if they stormed the consulate... He shook his head sharply, forcing himself to dispel these terrifying thoughts.\n\n"Ambassador, what should we do?" Keiichi Takenaka asked quietly beside him. Akamatsu took a deep breath, trying to steady his nerves. "Immediately contact the Chinese Foreign Ministry and demand increased police presence to ensure the consulate's safety", he said in a firm voice."

We have created an unprecedented digital totalitarian society. In this realm, there is no crime and no dissent. Each citizen operates like a cog in a finely tuned machine, functioning precisely under the Party's leadership, contributing to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.\n\nOur people are no longer tainted by the decaying ideologies of the West. Their spirits have been purified by patriotism and the core values of socialism. They love us, as children love their parents, as believers revere their deities. Now that we have eradicated internal enemies, the time has come to wash away our past humiliations with blood.\n\nWe will use their blood to honor the souls lost in the Nanjing Massacre, and their heads to avenge the women they ravaged!

The CNDCA suggested regional economic coordinated development, while the CZGP focused on overseas Chinese affairs, advocating for maintaining connections and support for overseas Chinese. The atmosphere at the conference was solemn and orderly.\n\nMeanwhile, a spokesperson for the CCP stated at a press conference, "The principle of long-term coexistence, mutual supervision, sincere cooperation, and sharing weal and woe remains unchanged. The restoration of the multi-party cooperation mechanism is a significant step in national governance." This cooperation is expected to once again provide multi-faceted perspectives for decision-making.\n\nAdditionally, experts have noted that the proposals and supervisory roles of the Advisory Parties have already shown positive impacts in practice.

Voters can participate through electronic voting systems or traditional paper ballots. The Central Election Leadership Group emphasized ensuring transparent and open electoral procedures.\n\nNotably, this election introduces an independent vote-monitoring system for the first time, with representatives from advisory parties comprehensively supervising the process to guarantee fairness and justice.

Meanwhile, other advisory parties have also seen varying degrees of increased representation.\n\nAt a press conference, the RC-KMT leader stated they will continue to uphold the principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" while fulfilling their role in political participation and consultation.

He stressed the CDL's commitment to promoting social harmony, economic development, and reforms in education and technological sectors. Political observers note that the CDL's rise reflects the ongoing evolution ofchina's political ecosystem and demonstrates the ruling party's determination to advance political system reforms.\n\nThis transformation signals the entry ofchina's multi-party cooperation system into a new era."

He carried Guandong through the most difficult times of the 2008 financial crisis, he was there for its' brightest moments of an economic and financial boom.\n\nWang Yang was looking at Guangzhou - the city-workshop of the world that provided billions of people on the planet with necessary and affordable consumer goods. Here he could clearly see that Guandong became the stronghold of his reforms. Here, the people were the most dedicated to the ideas of liberalization and democratization, revitalization through getting rid of the worst elements of the Chinese state, while taking the best from other countries.

And yet, now matter how many reforms were pushed through, no matter how many corrupt officials were gotten rid of, there was still one unresolved problem that stood like a knife in the heart of every citizen.\n\nThat problem lied across the Taiwan Strait.\n\nIt was never openly talked about by Wang Yang or any other of his allied politicians, but everyone knew: with all the talks about reform, openness and worldwide cooperation, one day the Chinese marines would have to reassemble in Fujian and try again. Not because we want war, but becausechina can't stay divided.\n\nTonight in Fuzhou Wang Yang was thinking over this again and again, reminiscing what had already been achieved and evaluating every option he had.

The People's Republic ofchina needs a new round of national multi-party elections."\n\nThis statement caused as much enthusiasm as it caused shock. Although the Chinese society was now one of openness, equity and liberty, many still saw this move as an ultimatum to Wang Yang. However, Wang Yang knew that the country would come to this moment eventually and didn't lose his head. When the party asked him for directions, he answered..."

But then... have we actually failed our goals? Then why am I being reprimanded?"\n\nUnfortunately, no one could read his thoughts. The fact of the matter was that the Communist Party ofchina would lose power in the country for the first time in decades, and with the loss of power comes the loss of the tools and resources that so many respectable people needed and joined the party for.\n\nFinally, the decision of the congress was voiced by the speaker:\n\n"...to exclude citizen Wang from the Politburo.""

After decades in politics, he had weathered countless storms and witnessed endless tides of change, yet at this moment, he felt an unprecedented sense of ease.\n\nCompared to the past, the domestic atmosphere was becoming increasingly open. On online platforms, young people freely voiced their opinions; in street corners and alleyways, ordinary citizens discussed current affairs and politics without the fear that such conversations might bring unwanted attention from the authorities. Even within the system, transparency seemed to be on the rise. It was said that some officials had begun to engage with the public in a more open and transparent manner. In some regions, local governments were even exploring deeper democratic decision-making mechanisms. Now, power was no longer the toy of a few but operated under the sunlight, subject to public scrutiny.\n\nFor Wang Yang, perhaps Chinese democracy was finally seeing its first spring."

He stood and walked to the window, gazing out at the ancient capital before him.\n\nOnce, despotism had been an invisible shackle, restraining the thoughts and actions of the people. But now, that old, decaying system had reached its end, like an elderly man at the twilight of life, unable to adapt to the new era. Yet, the conservatives in power clung desperately to the old order, resisting the wave of reform. They sought to stifle the momentum of change before it could take root. But in the end, the people chose freedom. Now, at last, they had the chance to fulfill their long-held dreams.\n\nHe turned back to his desk, his gaze falling on the pile of documents before him - plans for political reform. He knew that once this proposal was launched, it would cause a great stir. But Wang Yang also understood that the road to reform would never be smooth. To truly leadchina toward democracy and the rule of law, this "tough bone" had to be tackled. He picked up his pen and solemnly signed his name on the document."

He was skeptical-after all, he grew up hearing stories from his elders about the hardships of old Tibet and had witnessed the significant changes in his hometown under the Party's leadership. Deep down, he still believed in the Party and the government.\n\nWalking up the stone path, he noticed something unusual when he reached the monastery gate-the slogans that used to be displayed in the greenery were gone. Could the rumors be true? He quickened his pace into the monastery. The monks still wore their crimson robes, the Buddha statues continued to gaze at the snow-capped mountains-everything seemed unchanged. But then he saw monks removing the slogan "Unite around the Communist Party ofchina" from the walls. Approaching an elderly monk basking in the sun, he respectfully greeted him and asked, "Old Aba, why are these slogans being taken down?"\n\nThe monk smiled. "You may not know this, but policies have changed. The Party says it now respects our beliefs more. The old mandatory policies are being adjusted to fit our needs, and we are free to express our views. I believe it won't be long before the Party stops restricting us altogether.""

Yet, for Wang Yang, this inspection tour might just be the moment to assess the impact of his policies.\n\nIn Qinghai, he saw herders no longer remaining silent but courageously stepping forward to offer frank opinions on policy strengths and weaknesses. In Gansu, he witnessed farmers breaking free from past restraints and actively participating in local grassroots elections. In Xinjiang, he observed Muslims' religious rights being fully protected, with the shadows of the past swept away.\n\nThe loess remains heavy and cold, the desert still barren and desolate, but the hope buried deep beneath the sands will eventually bloom."

He had just finished a day's work, processing piles of documents, but the exhaustion in his body couldn't quell the surge of thoughts in his mind.\n\n"Freedom", this word had burned like a flame in his heart for most of his life. Now, he and his fellow liberals had finally broken the millennia-old cycle of authoritarian rule, planting the seeds of freedom in this land, scarred by the tides of history. The torch of democracy had been lit once more, blazing brightly in the hearts of every citizen. Yet Wang Yang knew this was only a brief victory; a long and arduous road lay ahead. They would have to overcome countless obstacles, cross mountains and seas, and shatter the chains of the old regime. Only then could the seeds of freedom truly take root in the hearts of the people and blossom in every corner of society.\n\nThe path forward remained treacherous, but history marches on.

However, the question of the future direction of the People's Republic and the best governance path for the Chinese people has remained unresolved. But now, it seems this question has found an answer. The digital Leninists in the upper echelons have gained a significant advantage in political battles and have forced other factions to accept their agenda.\n\nDigital Leninists have learned profound lessons from the numerous upheavals in Chinese politics since the Reform and Opening Up. They are determined to maintain national security and regime stability at all costs, using various means. They place a high value on technological progress and continually keep up with the latest advancements, although most of their technological applications are focused on social stability and military use. Digital Leninists emphasize using technology to build a united society and achieve "good governance", but they are also not hesitant to promote policies and rule the people with an iron fist."

china.203.t: "Military Spending Cuts"
china.203.d: "After the successful resolution of the Taiwan conflict, we've faced fiscal challenges pertaining to our military expenditures.\n\nIn light of the strain the war has placed on our economy, we've determined that our current military budget is excessive for our current circumstances. To tackle this issue, we've implemented budgetary reductions, along with scaling back conscription in certain regions and disbanding redundant military brigades."
china.203.a: "It's not like the PDTO is a threat anymore."
china.204.t: "Minor Government Changes"
china.204.d: "Following the victorious conclusion of the Taiwan conflict, we've encountered certain challenges stemming from our existing governmental framework.\n\nOur new geopolitical standing has highlighted the deficiencies within our current governance system. As a response, we have decided to initiate the long-delayed government restructuring plan to address these issues. The most notable changes are the retirement of former State Council Premier Li Keqiang and the Director of the Central Foreign Affairs Office, Yang Jiechi."
china.204.a: "A little change never hurt anybody."
china.205.t: "Victory Parade"
china.205.d: "Red flags and placards are seen everywhere giving Beijing a festive atmosphere. To celebrate the great victory of the Taiwan war, it has been decided that a festival will be held in the capital. These days men in uniform have become the most popular people in the city.\n\nOn the day of the celebration, headed by a parade of war heroes carrying honored military banners, including the first Marine to land on the Taiwan Island and the soldier that put the national flag on top of the Taipei 101. Xi waved to the soldiers with smiles on his face, and the soldiers spontaneously cheered "Long live President Xi!" as they passed through Tiananmen Square.\n\nThe parade lasted from daytime until late at night. It was followed by an open-air ball and concert. A parade of civilians marched through the streets of Beijing. Billions of people around the world watched the simulcast, and many saw it as the end of an old era."
china.205.a: "Long live the Chinese people!"
china.206.t: "Taiwan Remains under Military Control"
china.206.d: "Following our victory in the Taiwan War, we have successfully attained full control over Taiwan. However, achieving our operational goal has brought forth a host of challenges with the newly acquired territory. Issues such as local resistance, widespread corruption, and bureaucratic strains have necessitated our decision to institute military control over the island for the foreseeable future. \n\nWhile this move may not garner unanimous support within our government and among our citizens, it stands as the most prudent course of action currently. Our priority is to establish firm control and ensure stability on the island before undertaking the process of reintegrating it into our nation."
china.206.a: "It is only temporary."
china.207.t: "One Country, Two Systems"
china.207.d: "Nearly 50 years ago, Deng Xiaoping, the supreme leader ofchina, came up with an innovative idea of "One Country, Two Systems" for Hong Kong after the reunification. Basically, while the socialist structure remained in mainlandchina, Hong Kong was allowed to continue with its market economy and capitalist lifestyle.\n\nWe had to admire Deng's decisiveness and creativity. This tiny island city has continued to create investment and jobs inchina. At the same time, the system has also worked well for Macau, a former colonial territory recovered from Portugal after 1999.\n\nNow, with Taiwan finally return tochina after 1949, we will assure those politicians and civilians who have stayed because of their faith in the CPC that "Taiwanese rule Taiwan" is still possible."
china.207.a: "We sincerely wish the prosperity of Taiwan!"
china.208.t: "Gradual Stabilization"
china.208.d: "We've received encouraging news today. Recent polls conducted in Taiwan to gauge public satisfaction with the current government indicate a significant rise in support for our administration. Moreover, the Ministry of State Security has reported a decline in resistance efforts from Taiwanese rebels.\n\nThese developments underscore the success of our efforts in reintegration and stabilization. With continued positive developments like these, complete reintegration appears to be well within reach in the near future."
china.208.a: "Our brethren will be united soon!"
china.209.t: "Unification of Bureaucracy"
china.209.d: "Our ongoing efforts to reform the government structure in Taiwan have achieved a significant milestone today. Recent reports indicate a successful unification of bureaucratic frameworks between mainlandchina and Taiwan. \n\nAdministrators on the island have confirmed that administrative bodies, hospitals, police forces, and other key sectors have undergone substantial reforms to align more closely with the bureaucratic structure of the mainland."
china.209.a: "A step towards utopia."
china.210.t: "The Chinese Century"
china.210.d: ""Comrades, friends, compatriots!"\nXi was never supposed to be a good speaker. For the past decade, Xi's gaffes in every speech would always create a wave of vitriol on the Internet, and the new words that his secretaries would occasionally add to his boring speeches would often fail to impress the people, even if they were sometimes formalized as party slogans. But with today's speech, Xi was sure that no one would want to miss a word.\n"Today, we are holding military parade here to commemorate Taiwan's return to the motherland , and to honor this milestone on the history of the Chinese nation." Xi did his best not to make his voice too shrill due to nervousness. He noticed that the audience below the Tiananmen was almost silent.\n"Looking back at history, we, the Chinese, have gone through trials and tribulations, but we have never given up the dream of reunification and revitalization. with history rolling forward, no one can stop the historical tide of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation!" His voice became impassioned. With perfect timing, he raised his right fist high and pointed to the five-star red flag flying high on the Square. Xi was satisfied to see that the cheers and applause had boiled over. "Today, we stand at a new historical starting point, shouldering the historical mission of realizing the great Chinese dream! This is the inevitability of history, the victory of the people and the great victory of the Chinese nation!""
china.210.a: "A speech that will live in history."
china.211.t: "Enthusiasm of Chinese People"
china.211.d: "We have successfully completed the task of unifying Taiwan, but the international situation is becoming increasingly severe. We also face greater domestic challenges, making it essential to more effectively unite the Chinese people across different classes and regions. Ideological work in the new era cannot be addressed simply by issuing slogans or producing films. It requires reliable guidance and detailed plans from bureaucratic institutions. In this respect, no organization can perform better than the CPC.\n\nThe Central Guidance Commission on Building Spiritual Civilization, the Central Propaganda Department, and the Central Policy Research Office have each submitted different plans for the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau to consider. The more orthodox approach is to continue developing Chinese socialist theory, promoting the Chinese version of "universal values" based on the 24-character core socialist values, and reinforcing our position as a socialist counter to Western capitalism. Alternatively, a more radical approach suggests that, given the increasingly strained relations betweenchina and the Asian neoliberal camp led by Japan, the unity of the Chinese nation is under threat. This approach advocates emphasizing the nationalist slogan of "defending the Chinese nation", while also intensifying propaganda about our country's strength and prosperity to inspire national pride and enthusiasm among the people."
china.211.a: "We have to stick to Marxism-Leninism."
china.211.b: "Nationalism unites the vast majority of people."
china.212.t: "National Rejuvenation"
china.212.d: "The Politburo has confirmed and implemented the new ideological work guidelines.\n\nThe Party's propaganda has increasingly embraced nationalism. Propaganda portrays present-daychina as comparable to the prosperity and strength of ancient Chinese empires, particularly the Han and Tang dynasties, referring to it as a new "golden age" in Chinese history. The term "national unity" is also mentioned more frequently. The fifty-six ethnic groups are all acknowledged as part of the "long history of the Chinese nation", contributing to a "rich cultural heritage." However, despite the slogans of equality, the news media and cultural circles have focused more on the Han ethnic group. The Han people's historical wars of conquest over other ethnic groups are openly seen as part ofchina's martial tradition.\n\nAdditionally, a threat theory targeting imaginary overseas enemies has been constructed. The First Sino-Japanese War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the Korean War are extensively portrayed as crucial elements of modernchina's revolution. Historical foreign wars, such as the Imjin War during the Ming Dynasty, are also seen as precursors to the Cold War in the Western Pacific, emphasizing the persistent intent of enemies to destroychina. The separation and antagonism betweenchina and foreign countries are becoming more apparent. However, propaganda consistently portrayschina, whether in the distant past or near future, as the ultimate and sole victor."
china.212.a: "The Ambition of a Great Nation."
china.213.t: "Core Socialist Values"
china.213.d: "The Politburo has confirmed and implemented the new ideological work guidelines. \n\nThe Party's propaganda apparatus has become more closely aligned with Marxist principles. Current propaganda in the People's Republic ofchina often compares its achievements to the future communist society envisioned by Marx, Engels, and other thinkers, as well as to the peak of the Soviet Union, and refers to this period as a new "milestone" in communist development. The term "continuous self-revolution" is also frequently used. Xi has personally emphasized this, declaring that the Communist Party ofchina will continue to leadchina as the vanguard of revolution and development. The 24-character core socialist values are now referred to as the "shared values of the community with a shared future for mankind."\n\nAdditionally, a narrative of threats from hypothetical foreign enemies has been constructed. Events such as Allied intervention in Soviet Russia after World War I, the Soviet-German War during World War II, Japanese crackdowns on the Eighth Route Army guerrillas, and U.S. "color revolutions" against the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War are all viewed as precursors to a Cold War in the Western Pacific, highlighting the persistent imperialist ambition to destroychina.The separation and antagonism betweenchina and foreign countries are becoming more apparent. However, propaganda consistently portrayschina, whether in the distant past or near future, as the ultimate and sole victor."
china.213.a: "Socialist Revolution in the 21st Century."
china.214.t: "The Great Revival"
china.214.d: "The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has reached an exhilarating peak, with the Party's vision for a resurgentchina advancing with unstoppable force. Decades of bold leadership by the CPC have propelledchina from the dawn of economic reform in the 1970s to the forefront of global innovation. We now stand on the threshold of a new era, wherechina's meteoric rise as a dominant economic and political power is reshaping the world order. Historians will soon recognize this moment as a definitive break from the past.\n\nAs we advance with unwavering determination, the Chinese people follow a path illuminated by the Party's visionary leadership. From triumphing over extreme poverty to establishing a comprehensive social welfare system and launching the ambitious Belt and Road Initiative, each monumental achievement reflects the indomitable spirit of our people. The Party's guidance remains a radiant beacon, driving our progress to new heights and ensuring that our journey of transformation accelerates with relentless energy and vigor.\n\nIn this thrilling age, aschina's current achievements set a new standard for future triumphs, our nation strides confidently toward a brilliant future, embracing the promise of a resplendent tomorrow with fervent resolve and unyielding commitment."
china.214.a: "Glory to the Party and the people!"
china.215.t: "21st National Congress of the CPC"
china.215.d: "The 21st National Congress of the Communist Party ofchina has come to an end. Since the previous congress, the country has achieved great achievements: superpower status has been consolidated, Taiwan has been brought back under control, and in the process the imperialistic enemies have been defeated. Against the world chaos in the form of wars in America and Europe,china remains an island of stability and prosperity.\n\nDespite his respectable age, Xi Jinping was elected general secretary for the 4th time. In his speech, he said that will continue his course of previous years to strengthen stability in an constantly changing world, and that the coming years will be critical in the destiny of all ofchina.\n\n...\n\nSome time has passed since the congress ended.\n\nXi and several high-ranking generals and officials were in the audience.  There was a heated discussion about something important. Something that would start a chain of events that would change the world forever.\n\nFinally, a map of the Korean peninsula appeared on the big screen."
china.215.a: "Great things are coming."
china.216.t: "PDTO Activity in Eastchina Sea Increasing"
china.216.d: "Recently, we have noticed a suspicious increase in activity of PDTO forces in the Eastchina Sea. Enemy reconnaissance drones have been circling the region around the clock, and their ships and planes have begun to cross our sea and air borders quite frequently. In our attempts to counter this, our opponents simply hide, not intending to engage. And although activity continues to increase, it has not yet come to a direct military confrontation.\n\nGiven our active preparations for Operation Wu Qi, this raises serious concerns that some of our plans are known to the PDTO member states. For now, we have no choice but to try to deter incursions into our maritime and air borders and monitor the situation as it develops."
china.216.a: "It's worrisome... But keep preparing for "Wu Qi"."
china.217.t: "Cyber Attack"
china.217.d: "In the morning, another Wing Loong flew out to sea on a border protection mission: a small Japanese ship crossed our sea border. It had become a routine, the procedure always followed the same scenario. An enemy ship crossed the border, our radar detected it, a drone flew out to observe it, and pretty quickly the enemy ship left our waters, often the drones didn't even manage to spot them. But now something went wrong as usual.\n\nThe signal from the drone was instantly lost. It was not shot down or suppressed by Electronic warfare, our radars still recorded the continuation of its flight. a few minutes later, other communication systems with the drones began to fail one by one.\n\nIn a few hours, access to military databases was already lost, our best military IT specialists were trying to salvage anything. Things were very bad: everything stopped working altogether. Such a powerful cyberattack on military infrastructure had never happened before in the entire world.\n\nOne thing was clear. Something terrible is about to happen. Something we didn't plan for."
china.217.a: "Why now?! Save at least something!"
china.218.t: "Naval Engagement and Rocket Barrage"
china.218.d: "Only after recovering some of the infrastructure damaged by the cyberattack did we encounter something frightening. The newly activated radars showed tens of PDTO ships that had crossed our sea border and were moving in the direction of Fuzhou.\n\nThe PLAN forces moved out to meet the enemy flotilla, preparing to give battle.  It was clear that this time the Pacific Alliance forces were serious and a battle could not be avoided. At the same time, in many coastal cities numerous explosions were heard: air defense was working, fighting off enemy missile attacks targeting our military bases.\n\nAlthough the direct military confrontation is just beginning, one thing is clear: the big war has begun, and even though we wanted to start it ourselves, we did not."

china.222.d: "The new plenary session of the Central Committee of the CPC was recently held in Beijing. The top echelons of the party were present, and Xi, entrusted by the Politburo, delivered a report to the session. In addition to the official communiqué, the plenary session also brought about long-awaited personnel changes. At the highest level of the party's power structure, several younger cadres were added as members of the Politburo and the Central Secretariat. At lower levels, there was a more extensive rotation among provincial party secretaries and heads of State Council ministries and commissions.\n\nThe newly released resumes of the cadres reflect a degree of diversity. Among them are party secretaries promoted from grassroots organizations, management experts from large state-owned enterprises, leaders from higher education institutions and research organizations, and even military personnel who distinguished themselves in the Taiwan War. According to CCTV News, this reflects the "diversity in the party's talent selection path in the new era." Additionally, the official media highlighted the rotation of senior members in a uniquely Chinese manner. At routine commendation meetings, many senior cadres who had disappeared from the public eye for some time reappeared and received greetings from the Central Committee as "senior comrades." This suggests that the CPC has begun to shift its centralized model, focusing on cultivating and selecting a new generation of core forces for the party."

Three years ago, it was found frail and barely surviving at the edge of a polluted forest. This was the last time we observed the presence of golden snub-nosed monkeys in the wild.\n\nAutopsy Findings:\nThe body of RX-743 was severely emaciated, with fur that had dulled to a sickly yellow. Its eye sockets were sunken, and the inner eyelids showed an abnormal pallor, consistent with the severe anemia it suffered from in life.\n\nInternal Examination:\nThe lungs were filled with black mucus, the result of prolonged exposure to polluted air. The lung tissue was a pathological grey-black and lacked elasticity.\n\nThe heart was unusually small, with noticeably thinned ventricular walls, indicative of myocardial fibrosis, a common consequence of long-term exposure to high levels of pollutants.\n\nThe stomach was nearly empty, containing only a small amount of black, viscous liquid with a nauseating stench. The gastric mucosa showed extensive ulceration, and the intestinal walls were riddled with hemorrhagic spots, symptoms indicative of heavy metal poisoning.\n\nRX-743's body tested positive for extremely high concentrations of lead, mercury, cadmium, and other heavy metals. These toxins accumulated in its system over time, ultimately leading to its death. The source of this heavy metal contamination was industrial wastewater and vehicle emissions."

Villagers have repeatedly reported the issue to relevant departments without any resolution.\n\nAt the scene, the factory gates were tightly closed, and hundreds of emotionally agitated villagers gathered at the entrance. They explained that since the factory began operations, it has discharged pungent waste gas and wastewater. After irrigating their farmland, they harvested nothing, and there have even been instances of livestock deaths.\n\nThe villagers stated that they had complained multiple times to the local environmental protection department, but the problem remained unresolved. "Those cadres came, took a look, said nothing, and left." one villager said angrily.\n\n"Upon investigation, the factory indeed had some environmental issues, and we ordered it to rectify these within a deadline", the spokesperson from the Ecological Environment Bureau of Luoning County stated. However, he denied the villagers' claims of inaction, asserting, "Due to historical issues, it takes time to resolve them properly."\n\nDuring the investigation, the reporter found that the factory's facilities were rudimentary and did not meet environmental protection standards.

china.225.d: "Sad news has emerged from the Anhui Yangtze Alligator National Nature Reserve: the last wild Yangtze alligator, known as "Xiao He", was declared dead early this morning, marking the complete extinction of this ancient species in the wild.\n\nThe Yangtze alligator is one of the smallest crocodilian species in the world and is unique tochina. Once widely distributed in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, its population plummeted due to habitat loss, environmental pollution, and excessive hunting by humans. By the 1970s, the estimated number of wild Yangtze alligators had dropped to fewer than 100. Despitechina's efforts to protect the species through conservation projects, including establishing reserves and breeding centers, the population saw only a gradual recovery. No natural reproduction has been observed in the wild for the past five years, even after the species was downgraded from critically endangered.\n\nThe death of the last wild Yangtze alligator signifies the loss of its genetic pool in the natural environment. Although scientists attempted artificial insemination to increase their numbers, all efforts ended in failure."

The event, attended by top officials and international delegates, including President Xi Jinping and the then-Secretary-General of the United Nations, highlightedchina's remarkable progress. Despite facing severe sanctions following the Taiwan War and the impact of a new Cold War in East Asia on international trade,china achieved an average annual GDP growth of 5%, lifted over 800 million people out of poverty, and increased urbanization to over 70%, far surpassing expectations.\n\nIn his keynote address, President Xi underscored major achievements in infrastructure, such as the expansion of the high-speed rail network to over 60,000 kilometers and advancements in 5G technology, now covering 90% of the population. Additionally, innovations in renewable energy have madechina the world's largest producer of solar and wind power, greatly contributing to its carbon neutrality goals.\n\nThis series of success sets the stage forchina's next phase of development.

We have progressed from a time when we couldn't even produce a single car to now not only meeting domestic demand but also filling containers vessels with Chinese-made products across the globe, especially in those Western countries that once seemed out of reach.

The cultural and lifestyle differences have severely impacted relations between both sides.\n\nAlthough minor conflicts persist, no major incidents have occurred so far. Moreover, due to the lack of clear directives from higher authorities, most grassroots officials have adopted a non-action approach to handle these complex issues. However, the developed public opinion network has caused a flood of information about immigrant groups to inundate the public, leading to widespread criticism of the government on social media.\n\nInternational observers believe that if the Chinese government cannot promptly address the increasingly strained relations between local residents and immigrants, it is likely that rising nationalism will cause significant damage to the Party's prestige."

However, they soon took practical steps, leading to new developments in the situation.\n\nFaced with mounting dissatisfaction from the Chinese populace regarding the growing number of immigrants and their perceived impact on society, the government has enacted a stringent new immigration law. This policy overhaul introduces strict restrictions on migrant entry and residency, aimed at reducing the influx of foreign nationals and addressing the rising unease among local communities.\n\nThe new regulations are intended to tighten control over migrant populations, including more thorough background checks and limited work permits. This move by the government is seen as a direct response to public pressure and is expected to ease some of the discontent.

However, many geopolitical experts have agreed that the invasion was instead to safeguardchina's strategic interests within the region.\nAfter citing the need to protect its borders and safeguard stability in the region,china's military forces crossed into Myanmar territory, advancing towards key strategic locations.

As a result, battles have often erupted, with soldiers using stones and sticks as weapons. The Indian troops often had numerical advantage in the standoff, but the PLA can now quickly deploy its elite troops from the rear to the forefront via the new highway network in Tibet, launching surprise attacks on the Indians at night. A large number of Indian soldiers have fallen off the mountain roads and died during the retreat, including their commanders. In contrast, the PLA suffered only single-digit casualties.\n\nIn the aftermath, diplomats accused each other of intending to unilaterally break the status quo, but both sides claimed to have defended their territory. The Indians have threatened to send more troops to the front line due to the losses they suffered, but the PLA has demonstrated its progress in mountain warfare and determination to protect the motherland.

Such an outcome is quite unfortunate and disappointing, and rather embarrassing for our diplomats.\n\nIn Beijing, the nationalists and the militarists have begun to advocate military intervention against Bhutan to make them realize the power differential between the two countries and thus force them to change their minds. However, India has always regarded Bhutan as its traditional sphere of influence, and intervention in Bhutan's domestic affairs may lead to further deterioration of Sino-Indian relations."

However, what makes the situation worse is that the PDTO fleet has blocked important lanes such as the Strait of Malacca, the Lombok Strait, the Makassar Strait, and the Miyako Strait. They have also used missiles to attack our merchant fleets in the Southchina Sea and the Eastchina Sea. The geographical disadvantage has caused our maritime trade to plummet to its lowest point.\n\nAs the effects of the embargo deepen,  clear signs of material shortages and economic decline have appeared in the most prosperous eastern cities of our country. The people have begun to speak of the war with pessimism, and Germany's history of famine and domestic uprisings in World War I as a result of the British naval blockade have left officials extremely worried and troubled."

I have been running a garment processing factory since 2014, and the products were primarily sold overseas, generating profits that were once enough to enable my wife, my son, my daughter and me to live a prosperous life.\n\nWe had established good relationships with overseas distributors and our products could be found on the shelves in Vietnam, Singapore and Japan until the Taiwan War put the factory into bankruptcy. I shut down the equipment, disbanded the staff, and borrowed money from loan sharks. We had to sell our downtown apartment. Both of my children still needed to go to school, but I could barely afford the tuition. My wife is already planning to divorce me.\n\nMr. General Secretary, I would like to say that I have always thought that you could lead our country to greatness. But now, this war has caused countless people like me to live in misery. Is this the "great rejuvenation" you promised? I beg you to end this war and bring back peace!"

Since the outbreak of the Taiwan War, the naval blockade and economic sanctions have severely impactedchina's economy, causing a crack in its domestic stability. Now, however, the Russians may change this.\n\nRussian and Chinese ministers have signed massive economic cooperation agreements, Key components include tariff concessions for Chinese goods exported to Russia, along with permission forchina to utilize Russia's Siberian Railway, Central Asian Highway, and Arctic Route for multilateral trade. In return,china has been asked to purchase more Russian fuel at higher prices and to provide increased loans for Russian infrastructure projects, particularly airports and harbors in the Far East. The Russian Presidential Envoy to the Far Eastern Federal District told Chinese media that the agreements would "show more effectively that there is no limit to Russian-Chinese cooperation".\n\nWhile the opening of the Northern Route may marginally compensate forchina's loss of foreign trade, Russia's support is significant in restoring confidence among many developing countries hesitant to continue trading withchina. Additionally, Russia can effectively safeguardchina's new trade routes, particularly since PDTO missiles are not currently targeted at Vladivostok and Petropavlovsk."

Additionally, naval warships are increasingly seen in the disputed waters.\n\nConsidering the absolute disparity in national power, many would think that we could get the Vietnamese to budge by force. However, our strength also provides us with the alternative advantage of being able to offer negotiations first and take the initiative.

Despite the researchers' best efforts, they were unable to reduce the size and weight of the high-energy laser system to something a single soldier could carry. For the ever-changing battlefield, its mobility was clearly insufficient. Combined with other inefficiencies, such as its method of killing, large-scale deployment remains difficult. However, the R&D process and the project's results are still valuable, and as an auxiliary combat weapon, laser equipment can continue to play a significant role in other forms on the battlefield."

china.273.t: "The Xi Jinping Thought"
china.273.d: "In 1978, the CPC abandoned Mao's line of class struggle as the guiding principle, and shifted to Deng's focus on economic development. In the twinkle of an eye,china's development has achieved miraculous accomplishments, but at the same time, its dark side has become increasingly conspicuous. To solve these problems, one cannot seek answers from the works of Marx, Lenin, or Mao Zedong but must instead seek truth from practice. The Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is precisely the answer the Party has given to the Chinese people in the 21st century.\n\nThe Xi Jinping Thought, as defined by the CPC's chief theorist Wang Huning, is not a prediction about the socialist future, but more like a summary of the experience of the past forty years of reform and opening up. It emphasizes that an all-encompassing ruling party, that is, the CPC, shall lead all aspects of society, and the Party's strict promotion mechanism and uninterrupted anti-corruption campaigns will ensure the ideological purity of the vanguard. Furthermore, in order to bridge the ideological divide within the country, the thought adopts the slogans of "Common prosperity", "Chinese Dream", and "National Rejuvenation", which respond to the rising national pride and the demand for social justice inchina. As Xi's position becomes increasingly stable, the Xi Jinping Thought will continue to guidechina in the foreseeable future."

It features a large deep-water port capable of accommodating large surface vessels, including aircraft carriers, as well as various auxiliary ships.\n\nThe completion of the Phnom Penh Naval Base establishes a robust logistical hub forchina's navy in Southeast Asia, significantly enhancing its sustained operational capacity in distant waters. Additionally, the base is poised to effectively counteract the military activities of nations such as Japan, Australia, and India in the Southchina Sea. It provides strategic support forchina's South Sea Fleet while exerting pressure on the Pacific Defense Treaty Organization's military projection and supply lines."

china.277.d: "China's rapid economic growth has also created some of the worst environmental pollution problems in history. Soil erosion from excessive logging, air and water pollution from heavy industry, and the endangerment of many animal species due to the lack of regulation are all urgent issues that need to be addressed.\n\nSince Xi Jinping came to power, the government has introduced several radical environmental policies, and slogan "Clear waters and green mountains are as valuable as gold and silver mountains" has become a household word. In the past, there were concerns that strict industrial restrictions for environmental protection might lead to economic recession and widespread unemployment. However, these concerns have proven to be unfounded. By implementing industrial upgrading policies, such as promoting the rapid development of the new energy vehicle industry, many environmentally friendly industries capable of generating significant profits have become leaders in drivingchina's economy. Additionally, the utilization rates of new energy sources, including nuclear, solar, and hydropower, have reached new highs inchina. Another benefit of environmental improvements is that many natural scenic spots have reopened, boosting the tourism industry.\n\nIt seems that the Party's promise to the people has once again been fulfilled: the economy continues to grow, and the living environment has significantly improved."

china.277.d.large: "China's rapid economic growth has also created some of the worst environmental pollution problems in history. Soil erosion from excessive logging, air and water pollution from heavy industry, and the endangerment of many animal species due to the lack of regulation are all urgent issues that need to be addressed.\n\nToday, I believe we can declare the reform a "qualified success." The smog levels in major cities have steadily decreased, the Siberian tiger's habitat is expanding, and desertification in Inner Mongolia has been significantly reduced. Even in the once uninhabited regions of the Taklamakan Desert, new oases are emerging. These environmental reforms have been widely praised by both officials and the public and are considered one of the government's genuine achievements. As for the economic slowdown caused by these reforms, we will address it gradually through the ongoing process of industrial transformation and upgrading.\n\n"

Much like the entrenched practices inchina's bureaucratic system, any directive from the central government tends to get escalated at every administrative level-from the Premier's recommendations to the Vice Premier's instructions, to the Minister's directives, to the Governor's orders, and finally, to the Mayor's often rigid deadlines. This cascade of directives has led to a significant decline in basic industries across many regions. Furthermore, our short-sighted actions failed to include measures to help these regions regain their economic stability. The resurgence of forests has reduced available farmland, and the improvement of water clarity has forced the closure of many factories. While we have met our environmental targets, many people online remain indifferent to the so-called "reform achievements" focusing instead on the harmful effects of bureaucratism."

Many government officials still operate with the outdated mindset that "GDP is everything," willing to sacrifice environmental resources—such as vegetation, water, and air quality—just to boost economic growth on paper. Whenever the central government proposes reform measures, it seems that "supplementary opinions" are always introduced at the last minute, pushing the measures back into the discussion phase. If things continue this way, future generations may only be able to see giant pandas and baiji dolphins in museums, and daily life for citizens might mean wearing N95 masks on their way to work."

The exhibition features a variety of equipment, such as new camouflage uniforms and drones, accompanied by detailed explanations and data interpretations. The most popular exhibition hall displays meticulously crafted large-scale models of active ships, aircraft, tanks, and missiles arranged in parade formation. This setup provides a strong visual impact and makes the PLA's modernization very tangible.\n\nIn addition, the coverage of the PLA's joint exercises on the CCTV Military Channel has changed dramatically. Observers have noted that the PLA's new military doctrine appears to be actively implemented. Scenes of armored group charges and naval gunfire are becoming less frequent, replaced by images of PLA soldiers using smart terminals and working with reconnaissance robots. New mysterious heavy weaponry, such as an infantry fighting vehicle with a unique turret and a sleek black aircraft, occasionally appears on screen.\n\nBoth ordinary citizens and veteran officers agree that the PLA has become an impressive force, with its demonstrated combat capabilities increasingly matching its earlier claims."

The CPC Central Committee, along with other top governmental and military bodies, issued a 'Letter to the Party, the Army, and the People,' announcing the news in a somber tone.\n\nAlthough Jiang was considered to have lived a long life by Chinese standards, his passing still evoked sadness and mourning among the Chinese public. Jiang's tenure as General Secretary coincided with a golden age forchina's economy, characterized by a booming cultural and entertainment industry and a rising international status, making him widely remembered. Additionally, Jiang's personal charisma and rare sense of humor as a Chinese leader left a lasting impression. While Jiang will undoubtedly receive a state funeral, his prestige is perhaps better reflected by the people rushing to the gates of his former home in Yangzhou to mourn him in their own way, rather than through extravagant ceremonies."

Chinese officials quickly expressed their sorrow and determination on social media. The cause of the accident is still under investigation, but three officials have already been removed from their positions."

china.302.d: "The rapid spread of the Covid-19 Coronavirus has severely disrupted the order of the entire Hubei Province. People are disregarding the provincial government's traffic and travel restrictions, scrambling to drive away from cities where the outbreak has occurred, causing the province's highway network to become completely jammed. Considering that Hubei has been nationally renowned as the central transportation hub, the current chaos is quite ironic.\n\nThis is indeed a critical time, and it is impossible for civilian institutions alone to control the epidemic and restore order. Thus, the Central Military Commission issued directives for the troops of the PLA Central Theater Command to rush to aid Hubei first, with units from other regions to follow. Multiple medical teams have arrived at Wuhan Airport by transport aircraft, and urgently needed medical supplies, including masks, protective clothing, and ethanol alcohol, have been delivered to the epidemic area using military transport vehicles and rail lines. The PLA officers and soldiers will officially take on the responsibility of maintaining public order throughout the province. At the same time, they will also be entrusted with the arduous tasks of distributing essential supplies, constructing temporary hospitals and shelters, and assisting medical staff in carrying out treatments."

china.303.d: "As the pandemic spread, the Foxconn factory in Zhengzhou, Henan was inevitably affected. This massive industrial park, home to hundreds of thousands of workers, also implemented numerous zero-COVID measures. However, as the pandemic intensified and the number of confirmed cases increased, resources became increasingly strained. Due to insufficient spaces, positive cases were isolated in dormitories. Logistical support collapsed, leading to severe shortages of food and medicine. Yet, the factory never disclosed the number of confirmed cases, leaving workers to speculate about the infection situation through private group chats. Fear of infection caused massive absenteeism on the production line.\n\nRumors and panic permeated the factory. Society's widespread publicity about the consequences of infection further stressed workers, ultimately pushing them to decide to return home. Workers evaded security, climbed over walls, and crawled through holes to leave, walking tens or even hundreds of kilometers along highways to return home. Many kind-hearted citizens placed food and water along the roadsides to provide aid, and some transportation personnel, out of compassion, took risks to drive people back to their hometowns.\n\nTo date, Foxconn has not made any comments on the situation."

More than a decade behind bars had transformed the once deputy director of the Public Security Bureau into an elderly man with graying temples and a faltering gait. Dressed in an old jacket and carrying a slightly faded briefcase, he gazing at the high-rise buildings in the distance, his heart filled with mixed emotions. In 2012, he had been imprisoned for "illegally carrying and reading reactionary books", and his former power and status had vanished in an instant. \n\nZhong wandered aimlessly along the street until he saw a taxi approaching. He waved his hand, and the taxi slowly stopped beside him. The taxi carried him through streets that everything having undergone tremendous changes, except for him, who seemed stuck in the past.\n\nAfter an amount of time, the taxi stopped. Zhong paid the fare, got out of the car, and looked at the scene before him-the buildings looked more rundown than he remembered. Parts of the plaster had peeled off, exposing gray bricks underneath, and the corridor was filled with a musty smell.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Zhong entered the corridor. Relying on his memory, he groped his way to the door of his home. As he looked at the rusty iron door, his hand trembled. He couldn't remember how many years had passed. He slowly raised his hand to knock, but it felt so heavy he could hardly lift it.\n\n"Knock, knock, knock..." After a long hesitation..."

Even the boldest predictors did not dare to claim they would liberate all ofchina. However, they ultimately failed-not crushed by external enemies, but defeated by internal traitors. The so-called "socialism with Chinese characteristics" is in fact full of capitalist characteristics. Forty years of reform and opening-up have resulted in mass poverty and inequality, with economic growth benefiting only a minority.\n\nA frequently asked question is: Why does socialism make the poor poorer and the rich richer? No one seems to have an answer.\n\nIn this context, people are recalling dreams that have faded over the years. Hu's new government is determined to reclaim these lost dreams, no matter how difficult it may be. Whether they choose the old path of the Mao era or a new, untried path, they are striving to find an ideal Utopia.

As an old Party member and a scholar with traditional Chinese values, he believed that reverence for Chairman Mao and respect for Confucius could coexist harmoniously. However, tonight, something seemed off about the program. Although the respected professor on screen was discussing The Analects and The Classic of Filial Piety, his tone was not the familiar "applying the old to serve the present". Instead, the professor spoke of the "class limitations of Confucius." Listening to this, Grandfather Zhang felt a strange unease in his chest.\n\n"Son, what do you think of what he's saying?" He tilted his head towards Zhang Zhongshu.\n\nZhongshu, who was typing a message on his phone, glanced quickly at the TV before half-seriously, half-distractedly replying, "I think as children, we should still be filial and treat our parents well." \n\n"Grandpa, I actually think the professor has a point", Keren chimed in."Being good to our parents and grandparents is important, but children also have their own lives.

For many former political prisoners, this fate seemed destined to last forever. However, a recent decision by the Central Committee of the Communist Party has altered the destinies of many.\n\nIn the coastal city of Dalian-once a beautiful "garden city" of the north and a proud example of successful urban governance-Former Mayor of Dalian, and once a member of the politburo, Bo Xilai, sits watching television. Amid the hustle and bustle outside the sanatorium, whispers of remembrance occasionally surface, linking his name to the city's past glories. \n\nThe news presenter, with precise and clear enunciation, speak of the Party's new policies. Bo's age-spotted hand presses the rewind button, listening to the news once more, and then again, and again, until his once-strong hands tremble slightly, and tears streak down his wrinkled face.\n\nHe was free.

However, under the watchful eye of General Secretary, this situation is set to change.\n\nThe new Party resolution places great emphasis on the role of the United Front, and it also sets high expectations for the Conference's future mission in advancing socialist development. Its current powers of 'advisory' and 'proposal' rights will be strengthened, transforming them into formal participation in the legislative powers held by the National People's Congress. Moreover, the influence of professionals within the CPPCC will be further expanded. These reforms evoke memories of the early 2000s when former CPPCC Chairman Li Ruihuan, a former worker, proposed a similar direction.\n\nAdditionally, the composition of the CPPCC's representatives will be further refined and improved. Groups such as the Communist Youth League, from which General Secretary Hu himself rose, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions representing workers, and the All-China Women's Federation, among others, will gain greater representation and influence within the revitalized CPPCC.

We believe that increasing political extremism and social division in the U.S. will further jeopardize its national stability and profoundly affect the coherence and effectiveness of its domestic and foreign policies.\nAs the date of the U.S. presidential election approaches, the conflict between the populist political group centered around President Donald Trump and the anti-Trump political alliance will reach a climax. Due to the intertwined impacts of thechina-U.S. trade war, the COVID-19 pandemic, and various other factors, the number of groups highly dissatisfied with the Trump administration is gradually increasing, including both radical left-wing and extreme right-wing forces. Meanwhile, political activities by pro-Trump groups are also becoming more active, and violent conflicts are becoming more frequent.\nThis once again demonstrates the foresight of your assertion that "the world is undergoing changes unseen in a century." The MSS, synthesizing relevant intelligence, recommends that the Central Committee and the Central People's Government continue to maintain a high level of attention and prepare for the probability of more black swan events occurring.\n\nRespectfully yours,"

The division within the U.S. is now a foregone conclusion, and violent conflicts have escalated into multi-factional political struggles. The MSS has compiled relevant reports and hereby provides a brief summary to the Politburo.\nFirst, there are the forces within the two major ruling parties in the United States, primarily represented by the Constitutionalists led by Donald Trump and the Union government led by Joseph Biden. Currently, Trump and his supporters are gradually retreating to Denver, Colorado, standing in opposition to the Biden camp.\nAdditionally, various separatist forces are emerging from American grassroots political movements, with the Patriot Front being the most prominent. They mainly hold radical populist and nationalist views and can generally be classified as neo-fascists. The activities of more extreme alt-right organizations should also not be ignored.\nNotably, on the West Coast, particularly in California, multiple leftist forces have emerged, including several local parties that openly hold socialist positions. It is believed that they have begun discussing the possibility of forming a united front and have committed to the path of armed revolutionary struggle. Although the prospects are uncertain, this development could be significant for our country.\n\nRespectfully yours,"

The reason becomes clear when you look at the roads, now bustling with traffic and green license plates of electric vehicles everywhere.\n\nThe oil crisis severely affectedchina's traditional automobile industry but accelerated the development of new energy vehicles. Leading the charge was BYD Auto, followed by emerging companies like NIO and Xpeng Motors. These companies, with years of technical expertise and favorable government policies, quickly captured a significant portion ofchina's automotive market and began exporting their products overseas.

The spokesperson also urged external forces to stop tarnishingchina's reputation with false accusations.\n\nIn response, the Japanese government has lodged a formal protest withchina, urging stronger protection for Japanese citizens. Other countries, including Australia, South Korea, and Indonesia, have also expressed concern and advised their citizens inchina to exercise caution. Some analysts suggest that the recent attacks may be linked to strained Sino-Japanese relations and lingering prejudices and discrimination against foreigners among certain Chinese citizens. Others speculate that certain groups or individuals may be inciting nationalist sentiments behind the scenes.\n\nChinese police have initiated investigations, and some suspects have already been detained.

Surprisingly, the film is an adaptation of the science fiction series 'The Three-Body Problem' by Chinese author Liu Cixin. The book, which won the Hugo Award in 2015, has been praised by notable figures such as Barack Obama. To cater to American audiences, the film includes more diverse characters while reducing the roles of major Chinese characters - a decision that has reportedly drawn criticism from fans of the original novel.\n\nThe plot centers on two contrasting figures. One is a former Marine Corps commander, a traditional WASP elite, who leads his warship away from the fleet to escape destruction by a new alien weapon. His harsh methods of survival, sacrificing comrades to select a group of 'doomsday elites,' eventually lead to his downfall, as he is betrayed by his subordinates. On the other side, a former doctor turned politician, portrayed by an Indian-American woman, rises to power by promoting messages of "love" and "joy" in the post-deterrence era, gaining the support of the younger generation. However, her perceived weakness opens the door for the alien fleet to invade Earth.\n\nThe film sparked widespread discussion upon release. While it has been praised for its stunning visual effects, especially impressive given the wartime conditions, its overt political metaphors have drawn significant attention and prompted varied interpretations."

PDTO's main air power on the island is deployed in a bunker at its base in Jiashan, Hualien, on the east side of Taiwan, which is in the dead zone of our firepower coverage and poses a great threat to our landing forces and forward fleet. At the same time, photographs taken by pro-Mainland people on the island confirm that PDTO has deployed a large number of ground troops at the two northern landing sites at the mouth of the Danshui River and in Hsinchu in response to a possible beachhead landing by our forces.\n\nThe Ministry of State Security has synthesized the relevant intelligence and recommended that the Central Military Commission and the Central People's Government maintain a high level of concern and be prepared to deal with the inevitable PDTO counterattack during the liberation of Taiwan.\n\nRespectfully yours,"

In response, Indian forces allegedly strafed Pakistani posts near Sialkot to obscure their drone activity. India, meanwhile, accused Pakistan of initiating the incident, claiming that Pakistani troops had opened fire unprovoked on Indian posts in the Jammu border area. India characterized its counterattack on Pakistani positions as "proper retaliation", resulting in injuries to at least three Indian soldiers and the emergency evacuation of dozens of villagers.\n\nThe Ministry of State Security has synthesized this intelligence and assesses that the situation in Jammu-Kashmir could escalate into a fourth Indo-Pakistani war.

Rather than cutting back after America's decline, the central government increased support, establishingchina's aerospace sector as a beacon, a modern-day Noah's Ark amid global turmoil, carrying forward humanity's enduring dream of reaching the stars."

china.331.d: "Many years ago, the Judicial Network, a website created to inform the public about the progress of legal cases and the workings of the judiciary, was celebrated as a key step towards transparency inchina's legal system. It received widespread acclaim. However, during the era of Xi Jinping, as a part of his efforts to centralize administrative and judicial power, the transparency of the Judicial Network gradually declined, causing much distress among domestic liberals.\n\nWith changes in Party leadership, the Judicial Network has found an opportunity for revival. General Secretary Wang Yang has supported this effort, and Comrade Zhou Qiang, Secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, has ordered the restoration and enhancement of the network's functions. In the future, the public will be able to access not only open case files online but also trial processes and records for specific cases. As a leading figure in these reforms, Zhou Qiang's actions have excited liberals, signaling thatchina's judicial system is stepping out of its opaque past and moving towards greater transparency."

They supported each other as they stumbled out of the barbecue joint, some of them vomiting on the sidewalk while the more sober ones patted their friends' backs.

However, the deadly games of politicians and fanatics inevitably turn into nightmares for ordinary people. Since the war began, tens of thousands of civilians have been displaced, yet the nations backing the various factions continue to place their bets.\n\nMost foreigners have already left this troubled land, but sometimes leaving is not so easy. A journalist from Xinhua News Agency, adhering to his professional duty, stayed a few extra days to gather more information, only to lose contact with his organization. For a time, his fate was uncertain. After a period of silence, he finally posted a video on social media, revealing that he was at Tehran International Airport, preparing to board a flight home.\n\nAs a journalist, one might expect him to be composed, but in the video, he appeared disheveled, with bloodshot eyes and slightly disorganized speech. His numb expression and forced smile left viewers wondering what this unfortunate Chinese journalist had endured.

He enthusiastically reassured the Taiwanese businesspeople during the United Front meeting. Among the audience was an invited businessman, listening attentively to the promises that the Chinese government would respect their property and business operations.\n\nMeanwhile, outside the meeting room, another entrepreneur who hadn't been invited was pacing in the lounge. As the official finished his address and entered the lounge, the uninvited entrepreneur hurried over and asked, "Sir, I want to attend this forum too. Why wasn't I invited? I noticed people inside who were once donors to the Democratic Progressive Party. Why are they allowed to attend?"\n\nThe official took a sip of water and calmly replied, "I've already spoken to him.

Mr. Lin, who lived with his wife, daughter, and elderly mother on Heping East Road, had lost his job at a local business after the military takeover. Now, the family relied on their savings to get by.\n\nWith the pleasant weather, Mr. Lin decided to take his family out for a bowl of mian xian. The soldiers patrolling the streets were disciplined and did not seem intimidating. After dinner, the family headed home.\n\nHowever, as they approached their neighborhood, they were startled to see military engineers and police setting up barbed wire and installing a metal turnstile at the entrance. The Lins, along with their neighbors, watched in shock and anxiety. A loudspeaker blared the latest government directive: a curfew would be enforced from 9 p.m. to 7 a.m., and entry into the community would now require ID checks.\n\nResigned and feeling helpless, Mr. Lin gently tugged his daughter's hand as they passed through the turnstile to return home."

To this, our great leader Mao Zedong responded with, "A single spark can start a prairie fire." Even if the Red Army temporarily succumbed to reactionaries, the support of the people and the guiding light of communist ideals enabled them to rise from the ashe, growing stronger and eventually triumphing over bourgeois tyrants and imperialist puppets.\n\nAs we look back, it seems we have once again found ourselves on a similar historical path. While many criticize the regressive policies during Xi's rule for inflicting great harm on the Chinese populace, if we trace the roots, the seeds of destruction were sown during Deng's era. Deng's slogan cleverly deceived the majority, causing people to lose their drive and faith, transforming them into beings controlled by materialism and cynicism. More importantly,china's abrupt transformation directly hampered the revolutionary progress across Asia-Pacific nations, inflicting irreparable damage, and in forty years, rendering them almost powerless.\n\nFate has now presented us with another chance to reverse the tide. This time, we will not take the hearts and minds of millions for granted; this time, we will not ignore the outstretched hands of our oppressed comrades in Asia.

The diplomatic representative of the Royal Coalition paced the floor, his mind in turmoil.\n\nSince the outbreak of the civil war, the Coalition had realized they were no longer welcome. Yet, losing the war meant a fate worse than death. Desperate, he had come to Bahrain, determined to find a nation willing to back them at any cost. Just hours ago, he'd met secretly with Chinese diplomats, seeking their support. In exchange for help in toppling the current king, they had promisedchina a steady supply of Saudi oil.\n\nThough the Chinese diplomat remained expressionless, the representative sensed his proposal had made an impression. They were calculating the risks and rewards of this high-stakes deal. 'We need time to consider,' the diplomat had said. Now, the representative waited anxiously for their answer - an answer that would decide not only his fate but the fate of Saudi Arabia.\n\nAs the minutes dragged on, the room felt suffocating. He walked to the window, pulling back the heavy curtains to watch the first light of dawn break the night. Just then, the phone rang. His heart skipped as he rushed to the desk.

They transformedchina, guiding it out of past turmoil and toward modernization, creating an economic boom that captured global attention. From land reforms to the creation of Special Economic Zones and restructuring state-owned enterprises,china has advanced - despite facing challenges along the way.\n\nHowever, rapid economic growth and improved living standards have also concealed significant problems, such as widespread corruption and increasing social inequality. Bureaucratic elites have increasingly exploited the public, limiting welfare through the household registration system, restricting land supply, and driving up housing prices. In addition, loose monetary policies have drained people's savings while ignoring basic market principles.\n\nThese mistakes can no longer be tolerated. The people deserve to enjoy the benefits of their work, rather than endlessly contributing to the profits of bureaucrats and capitalists. We aim to rebuild the welfare and consumption systems, reduce reliance on exports and savings, and ensure that citizens share in the nation's economic growth. Key laws and institutions will protect the people's rights, while diverse workers' organizations will empower them to resist exploitation.

Your actions constitute severe violations of labor rights..."\n\nThe judge's firm voice echoed through the courtroom, but Cao wasn't listening anymore. He had once believed money could buy everything - dignity, freedom, even power over others - but now he realized how terribly, tragically wrong he had been.\n\n"In accordance with Articles 244, 248, and 276 of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic ofchina, the court sentences defendant Cao Dewang to life imprisonment, with the confiscation of all personal property..."\n\nCao's legs buckled, his body collapsing instinctively, but the court officers hoisted him up without a word. His lips trembled, but no sound came. He could only watch as the gavel fell.

During every Party Congress, global observers speculated about promotions, transfers, and retirements within the Party and state, each offering differing predictions.\n\nToday, however, as General Secretary Hu Chunhua addressed the attentive administrative cadres, he felt a deep sense of pride in the sweeping reforms that had reshaped the bureaucracy.\n\nAmong the cadres, some had risen based on their professional qualifications, others due to their strong governance at the local level, and some through direct democratic processes, transitioning from National People's Congress representatives to government officials with strong ties to the people.\n\nThis diverse promotion system has dismantled the opaque workings ofchina's bureaucracy, injecting transparency into the network of power. Under this new system, cadres are more focused on serving the people, not just pleasing their superiors. As a result, "Serve the People" is no longer just a slogan."

Since the turn of the century, more and more Chinese have begun rediscovering Chairman Mao's legacy, and the Party Central Committee, responding to this trend, is set to reintegrate him into the political and cultural fabric of the nation.\n\nThe Party's ideological officers recognize that Chairman Mao was not only a charismatic poet, politician, and military strategist, but also a figure of enduring significance. As a result, the Party has started incorporating Mao's bold and imaginative works into the broader cultural industry. His remarkable military strategies - such as the "Four Crossings of the Chishui River" during the Long March - are being retold in documentaries. His thoughts and writings are now prominently featured in textbooks, not as mere addition to Deng Xiaoping's or Xi Jinping's contributions, but as central ideas in their own right.\n\nToday, a "Mao Thought revival" is sweeping across society.

However, it is lamentable that a significant portion of our party and military leaders seem to be infatuated with "technological determinism", placing undue faith in modern war machines while neglecting the indispensable role of the "people" in the People's Army.\n\nSuch fallacies have brought us disgrace. The painful defeat in the Taiwan conflict tarnished the once formidable image of the People's Liberation Army. Nevertheless, every cloud has a silver lining. The National People's Congress has already passed a comprehensive amendment package to the National Defense Mobilization Law. Through these laws, we will revive the lost concept of people's war. Youth will undergo further military training, the vitality of militia organizations will be enhanced, and even grassroots armed forces will be equipped with more weapons...\n\nIndeed, warfare technology is crucial, but in the name of the People's Liberation Army, the word "People" comes first.

china.346.d: "Since the Reform and Opening-up, for the past forty years, the cultural domain has been dominated by bourgeois liberals and Westernized factions. In the realm of cinema, Hollywood is hailed as the gold standard, while television dramas draw heavily from Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong. The art of drama has become a relic of the past, and traditional opera has been reduced to a caged bird singing only of romantic tales.\n\nThis situation cannot continue any longer! At the founding of our nation, we once possessed a flourishing red culture, where revolutionary romanticism was combined with realism that reflected everyday life. This produced numerous outstanding works such as the oil painting "Taking the Luding Bridge by Storm", the novel "The Red Flag", and "Red Crag", all of which were immensely popular among the masses. Unfortunately, with the advent of the Cultural Revolution and so-called "model operas", this cultural theory lost its footing and was relegated to the annals of history.\n\nHowever, now, the Party and the government are determined to reclaim the essence of socialist culture, and rebuild a culture that embodies both the red spirit and national character of our People's Republic. While we will continue to learn from advanced global forms of expression, the era where bourgeois liberals dominate the cultural field is gone forever!"

However, history has shown that economic growth can disproportionately benefit vested interests while neglecting the broader public good. We are now taking action to change this trend, ensuring that the benefits of economic development are shared equitably.\n\nOur first priority is transforming private ownership in the real estate sector. The market has often been manipulated, turning housing into a tool for exploitation. Restrictions on land use, combined with high taxes, have pressured ordinary people to spend their savings just to secure a home. Moving forward, we will treat housing as a basic necessity, fully supported by the government. Initiatives such as public rental housing, affordable housing, and diverse public housing options will benefit thousands of families.\n\nAdditionally, we will re-collectivize industry and agriculture and reintroduce labor-management negotiation systems. We aim to establish vibrant, self-governing labor organizations with leaders elected directly by workers. These leaders will oversee operations and protect workers' rights, fostering a fulfilling life for everyone involved.\n\nWe will also focus on other critical areas, including educational equality, nuclear energy utilization, ecological protection, and market fairness.

china.348.t: "Shift More Power to the NPC"
china.348.d: "According to the relevant provisions of the Constitution of PRC, several specialized committees are established within the National People's Congress. These committees do not possess the attributes of a power body; instead, they are institutions tasked with specific duties under the leadership of the power body. This is considered significant evidence that the NPC's merely serves as a "rubber stamp." Furthermore, most members of these committees are former provincial and ministerial officials who have retired and lost their power, making their influence rather limited.\n\nHowever, recent developments inchina's political landscape have once again captured the attention of observers and analysts worldwide. According to a spokesperson from the Central Propaganda Department, the State Council, as well as the National Supervisory Commission, have transferred some of their powers to the specialized committees of the NPC. These committees include the Supervisory and Judicial Committee, the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Finance and Economic Committee.\n\nAs the so-called highest state authority, this move is seen by some as a significant advancement in guiding political practice through the spirit of the Constitution. Nevertheless, there are concerns that this may lead to an excessive expansion of the NPC's powers, blurring the line between legislative and executive powers. Regardless, it appears that another layer of the veil overchina's political black box has been lifted."

china.349.t: "Resisting Reform"
china.349.d: "The cadre selection and appointment reform plan, decided by the central government, aimed to break the entrenched "factionalism" and "clique culture" in local Party committees. By implementing a more open and transparent selection mechanism, the plan intended to elevate genuinely virtuous and capable individuals to leadership positions.\n\nHowever, as soon as the reform was proposed, it caused significant unrest within various local Party committees. Some local Party leaders resisted, believing that the central government's move would weaken the power of Party committees and make local governments ineffective. They feared that the reform would restrict their authority and diminish their influence.\n\nFor Party committees in some remote regions, this cadre selection reform is seen as a direct assault on their interests. Yet, as the saying goes, "When the cat's away, the mice will play." Following Xi Jinping's downfall, factionalism in various local Party committees has worsened, making the implementation of reforms exceedingly difficult."
china.349.a: "They outwardly comply but inwardly resist."
china.350.t: "Question of Trade Unions"
china.350.d: "Since 1949, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has exerted unified leadership over local and industrial trade unions for many years. As a member of the "social organizations participating in the CPPCC", it is significantly influenced by government bureaucracy and is explicitly required by law to accept the leadership of the CPC.\n\nSince the reform and opening-up, the ACFTU has gradually lost its role as an association led by workers to represent and protect their legitimate interests. This decline culminated in 2018, when it was stripped of its control over various welfare institutions and industry associations, which it previously managed, and was forced to establish so-called "economic partnership" relationships with these entities. Furthermore, subordinate trade unions lack collective bargaining rights and are often led by senior corporate managers, reducing them to branches that primarily organize recreational and cultural activities within enterprises.\n\nOur new policy aims to alter this situation. Currently, two mainstream opinions. One advocates for completely lifting state control over trade union organizations, allowing the existence of non-state trade unions and other labor rights organizations. This, proponents argue, is the only way to truly protect workers' rights. The other one, considering the affair of social stability, supports the continued existence of state trade unions but calls for deep reforms. These reforms would restore the key powers of unions and expand their autonomy."

china.351.d: "As General Secretary Hu Chunhua's sweeping social reforms take full effect, the atmosphere of public discourse inchina has noticeably shifted. From traditional media like newspapers, television, and radio to burgeoning internet platforms, most agree that the Party's reform policies have given the public more room to breathe freely. Unfortunately, not everyone shares this sentiment.\n\nA considerable number of intellectuals and prominent figures inchina's cultural and economic spheres have long been critical of the Party and the government. This time is no different. Even within the somewhat more open environment provided by the state, some of these figures have made tentative, snide remarks, accusing Party leaders of having "no faith in democracy" and "lacking the courage for full openness." The comment sections of these discussions are filled with heated debates between supporters and detractors. On the whole, most people believe that this hard-won freedom should be cherished and not recklessly undermined by rash criticism.\n\nIn fact, some liberal-leaning figures within the government also feel that the current pace of reform is a bit slow. Hu's predecessors in the Communist Youth League have even suggested that Hu should "boldly carve out a new path." However, these discontented liberals may be overlooking something or perhaps fooling themselves. The Party's reforms are not intended to imitate the West but to forge a unique democratic path of its own."

china.352.d: "The Party's propaganda machine roars to life, spreading the latest successes of Central Committee's dual push for political and economic reforms across the vast population of over a billion people. The conservative forces, still rooted in the Deng Xiaoping and Xi Jinping eras, grumble about the sweeping openness and transparency, while the fanciful voices of the liberal elite buzz with complaints that the government is hesitant and cautious with reform.\n\nLet them complain! General Secretary Hu Chunhua has found new allies among intellectuals and the general populace. Prominent scholars such as Wang Shaoguang, Hu Angang, Cui Zhiyuan, and Zhang Yibing have all voiced their firm support for Hu's reforms - whether through articles in major publications or interviews on television, they passionately outline their approval of the new direction.\n\nProfessor Wang Shaoguang of Hong Kong University emphasized thatchina's current reforms differ from the political changes influenced by Western bourgeois democratic systems in the 1980s. Instead, they draw inspiration from the concept of "civil society" in the West, but with a twist -china is building a "people's society" that is rooted in the nation's own context. The central actors in this "people's society" are the laboring masses across the country. This theory has gained widespread traction in society, bolstering the Party's confidence in pushing forward with reforms."

china.353.t: "The First Chief Executive of the Taiwan SAR"
china.353.d: "After the initial excitement of reclaiming Taiwan fades, the real challenge begins: governing the island. This task involves not only healing the scars of war but also demonstrating the superiority of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics over the Three Principles of the People. Only then will the discontented population fully embrace Beijing's governance and align with the People's Republic ofchina.\n\nThe selection of the leader for the SAR is a critical task and must be approached with care. This individual needs to be skilled in working with Beijing while also capable of managing the underlying tensions within Taiwan, ensuring that governance extends beyond just Taipei City. One candidate is Hung Chi-chang, a former leader of the New Tide faction within the DPP. When the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag was replaced by the Five-star Red Flag, Hung immediately aligned himself with the mainland government. The New Tide faction, known for its "mass line" approach, seeks to influence politics through social movements and external party activities. With a tightly-knit organizational structure and a focus on democratic centralism, the faction became known as a "party within a party" within the DPP. Hung played a key role in quickly establishing a provisional administrative body that effectively managed Taiwan's post-war recovery.\n\nAnother candidate is Tsai Eng-meng, the founder of Want Want Holdings Limited and a media mogul, who was once one of the wealthiest individuals on the island. Tsai has long been active in working to improve relations across the Taiwan Strait. Even during periods of heightened tensions, he openly supported the concept of "One Family Across the Strait" and opposed Taiwan separatism. Additionally, Tsai is known for his strong Chinese nationalism and cultural conservatism. While his views once attracted criticism from both the Taiwanese government and the public, today they have become key assets in his political career."

To students, the textbooks had never delved deeply into this subject before. Often, teachers didn't ask them for their opinions but simply outlined which would appear on exams. So now, when the old teacher asked, none of them could answer.\n\n"Democracy is not just a system, but a way of life, a set of values. It means respect, tolerance, equality, and freedom.

Being a delegate to the People's Congress was just one important node in this network, and the annual meetings of the Dongguan PC Standing Committee felt more like a formality. Everything had always been settled long before any official discussions. Yet, something about this year's session felt unusual. Seated diagonally behind Zhong was a newly elected young representative-Jiang Shiyuan. His idealism contrasted sharply with the weary expressions of the older delegates in the hall.\n\nThe meeting proceeded to the voting segment. The host on the podium read out the proposal:\n\n"...Regarding the Optimization of Dongguan's Business Environment Ordinance..."\n\n"All those in favor, please raise your hand."\n\nThe sound of hands rising in unison echoed through the hall. Despite the pre-arranged consensus to pass the proposal, Zhong-who owned a factory-knew this policy would only reduce his profits. Still, for appearances' sake, he reluctantly raised his hand. Glancing back, he noticed Jiang Shiyuan frowning at the document in his hand, his fingers tapping lightly on the table as if deep in thought.\n\n"All those opposed, please raise your hand."\n\nSilence.\n\nThen, slowly, Jiang raised his right hand. The hall erupted into chaos. Shock, confusion, disdain, and curiosity intermingled in the stares directed at Jiang.\n\nZhong was taken aback at first, but then a sense of satisfaction welled up within him."

Slogans plastered along the streets and campaign messages blaring through speakers were a constant reminder of the day's significance-though none of it mattered to Zou. He only wanted to reach the nearest polling station, complete what he considered a meaningless ritual, and then head home to enjoy the noodles his wife would be cooking.\n\nStopping at an intersection, he glanced around aimlessly. Across the street, a group of elderly volunteers in red vests were eagerly handing out flyers to passersby.\n\nWhen the light turned green, Zou crossed the street quickly and arrived at the entrance to his residential area, where a makeshift polling station had been set up. A few tables were haphazardly joined together under a small tent, holding ballot boxes and voting slips. Several staff members sat behind the tables, their boredom palpable.\n\nZou approached the tent, pulled his ID card from his pocket, and handed it over to one of the workers. The worker barely glanced at it before asking, without even looking up, "Who are you voting for?"\n\nZou picked up a ballot and glanced at the candidate names-faces he had never seen before. Aside from their names and brief resumes, there was also a list of policy outlines, which was a new addition compared to past elections. He absentmindedly ticked a random name, then slipped the ballot into the box and turned to leave. The entire process felt like checking off a trivial chore.\n\nAs he stepped out of the polling station, Zou exhaled deeply, feeling a weight lift off his shoulders. He looked up at the gray sky, musing to himself. It didn't matter who won; these officials, whoever they were, only served their own interests. Why would any of them truly care about the lives of ordinary people?\n\nWith that thought lingering, Zou quickened his pace, heading home."

Members of the "Tiananmen Mothers" movement, who have been under strict surveillance and banned from public activities for a long time, have reappeared. They held the first mainland commemoration of the June Fourth Incident victims in over thirty years, in the very heart ofchina, just a wall away from the Forbidden City and a stone's throw from the Chang'an Avenue where tanks once thundered by. The long-missing former professor Ding Zilin, delivered a speech, describing the evening as a milestone moment and expressing her belief that the future ofchina will see greater progress in recognizing the 1989 victims.\n\nWithout the tacit approval of the government, it would have been impossible for the movement to hold such an event. Although official newspapers, news channels, and social media platforms remained silent, videos of the candlelight vigil quickly spread through citizen-captured footage, causing a significant public stir. Various individuals voiced their opinions; self-proclaimed "patriotic" media harshly criticized the event, denouncing it as an ideological "self-destruction." However, a larger number of ordinary people expressed a tolerant and cautious support. Enough time has passed since the 1989 turmoil for several generations to grow up, and many believe that instead of continuing to avoid the topic, it would be better to address it with an open attitude, which might actually be the best way to resolve historical grievances."

china.406.d: "Assessment Report on the Current State of Beijing’s Administrative Efficiency:\n\nRecent investigations indicate significant efficiency issues within Beijing’s administrative framework. There are extensive overlaps in departmental responsibilities, resulting in fragmented oversight and frequent buck-passing. Even straightforward approval items can require shuttling between multiple agencies. On average, a medium-scale project must undergo reviews by more than seven departments, taking between three and six months to complete.\n\nDespite having a sizable staff, there is a shortage of capable personnel handling core tasks. Surveys show that over 30% of employees in frontline offices need to improve their job skills. Excessive energy is devoted to internal meetings and document circulation, leaving insufficient attention for direct public services. Information flow between different levels is inefficient, with instructions prone to distortion or misinterpretation as they pass through multiple layers.\n\nUnless the relocation of administrative departments proceeds in a timely manner, it will not only slow down construction efforts in Xiong’an New Area but also exacerbate Beijing’s declining administrative efficiency, creating a vicious cycle: rising urban pressures further reduce efficiency, while low efficiency, in turn, hinders the relocation process. Once this situation takes hold, it will impede both the optimization of the capital’s functions and the broader Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei integration strategy, with far-reaching negative impacts."

china.407.d: "Xinhua News, Guiyang (Reporter Jiang Qiaoling) - In recent years, with the rapid development of information technology, digital credit reporting systems have emerged as a novel regulatory tool, gradually entering the public sphere. These systems are playing an increasingly important role in assisting governments at all levels in monitoring expenditure data in real-time, enhancing fiscal transparency, and combating corruption. Traditional anti-corruption efforts often rely on whistleblowing and inspections, which are prone to delays and passivity. In contrast, digital credit reporting systems provide new approaches and tools for anti-corruption efforts.\n\nGuiyang City has established a citywide digital credit platform by integrating data from banking, tax, and business departments, covering all municipal government agencies and public enterprises. This platform collects and analyzes financial transaction data from relevant entities and individuals in real-time. When abnormal transactions are detected, the system automatically issues alerts, prompting disciplinary and supervisory authorities to intervene. In addition to being a powerful tool against corruption, the digital credit system is a critical means to enhance government credibility. The Guiyang government has incorporated all fiscal revenue and expenditure data into the platform and regularly discloses this information to the public. Through mobile apps and websites, citizens can access information on departmental budget execution and project fund usage, achieving "transparent finances."\n\n"Now the public can clearly see where government funds are going, so we, as financial managers, must exercise even greater caution", said Finance Bureau Director Guan Lu."

To effectively safeguard cybersecurity and protect citizens' personal information,china has been intensifying cybersecurity initiatives and advancing the development of a digital credit system, achieving notable results.\n\n"We are battling various cyberattacks every day", said Lin Xingchen, head of the Cybersecurity Data Center. "In recent years, we have continuously ramped up our monitoring and interception of cybersecurity threats such as phishing websites, malware, and network attacks, blocking millions of harmful messages daily and effectively curbing cybersecurity incidents." According to statistics, in just the first half of this year, the National Cybersecurity Data Center intercepted over 100,000 phishing websites and handled hundreds of thousands of cybersecurity incidents.\n\n"Thanks to the digital verification app, I didn't fall for the scam!" shared Ms. Wang from Panyu, Guangzhou, with the reporter. Recently, Ms. Wang received a call from an unknown number, where the caller claimed to be from the "public security bureau", alleging that she was involved in a money-laundering case and needed to transfer her bank funds to a "secure account" for investigation.

Smoke rose slowly in the sunlight, merging with the mist that lingered over the distant skyline of high-rises. His gaze rested on the cranes casting long shadows in the morning light, resembling the skeletons of prehistoric beasts reassembling themselves into a futuristic city on this plain. He recalled the constructivist architecture and Vkhutemas designs he had studied in his university textbooks - those futuristic sketches that once mesmerized him. Perhaps in a few years, when visitors stand on this land and look up, they will witness designs far more breathtaking than those in the books.\n\nTwo days ago, he had received an invitation from his alma mater, asking him to return and share his experiences with younger students. He wanted to tell them that the future isn't just an abstract idea in books - it's built by the hands of every worker. Watching a building rise taller every day, knowing you played a part in its creation, brings a sense of fulfillment that no theory can compare to.\n\nTaking a final drag from his cigarette, Wang carefully stubbed it out in the corner of the wall. As he adjusted his faded safety helmet, a vision flashed through his mind: years from now, standing atop a skyscraper with his child, looking out over the city. He would point to a corner of the skyline and say, "Look, that building over there - that's the one your dad helped build."\n\nBy then, Xiong'an would be a city that amazes the world, a testament to the dreams and sweat of hundreds of thousands of builders like him."

The article highlights that, as Beijing's functions continue to expand, the operational costs of government institutions have been rising, and administrative efficiency urgently needs improvement. According to relevant statistics, approximately 40% of administrative resources are currently consumed by internal institutional operations.\nIn response, the Central Committee held a special meeting to discuss the matter, with some members of the Standing Committee offering additional suggestions on the timeline for relocation. Subsequently, Xi issued an important directive, emphasizing the need to resolutely advance reforms and support Xiong'an New Area in taking on greater national responsibilities.\nIn line with the requirements of the new era, Minister Tang proposed relocating the majority of core government functions to Xiong'an. As a key pillar of the national strategic layout, Xiong'an covers a planned area of 2,000 square kilometers and is fully promoting digital governance innovations. It is expected that institutional streamlining in the area could reduce administrative staffing by 30%.\nThe results speak for themselves: Xiong'an's achievements in smart city development have been remarkable.

Since its establishment, the construction of Xiong'an has adhered to the principles of "global vision, international standards, Chinese characteristics, and high-level positioning," and has made remarkable progress. The basic infrastructure framework has taken shape, ecological quality continues to improve, iconic projects have been implemented, and the appearance of the new city is rapidly changing.\nHowever, compared to Beijing, Xiong'an is still in its early stages of development.

He could still remember visiting this site over a decade ago when it was nothing more than barren land. Yet today, everything had been transformed.

The news sparked intense discussion across social media.\n\nAt the press conference, the Committee spokesperson stated: "After careful consideration, we've decided to reevaluate this period of history."\n\nSubsequently, the Supreme Court announced a review of relevant detainees. The first batch of releases included leftists who had opposed official profiteering and privatization. When they walked out of prison, their hair had turned grey.\n\n"After all these years, the day has finally come," said one released individual in an interview. Reports indicate they will be assigned to universities and think tanks to participate in policy research.\n\nThat evening, some released leftists held a symposium. They discussed the recent changes: union reforms, enterprise democratization, and increased mass participation. Everything seemed to be developing in the direction they once pursued.\n\nRelevant authorities have established a special working group to comprehensively review historical issues based on seeking truth from facts. Regarding cases of different nature, the Committee indicated they would be addressed in the next phase."

The crowd burst into applause. Yu froze - talk about déjà vu. Years back, they'd stood just like this outside the factory, fighting for their right to unionize. Except back then, they got beaten up instead of applause.\n\nJasicTech? That's "People's Machinery" now. Workers actually sit on the board, while those high-and-mighty Taiwanese bosses? They ran with their cash, but their assets are locked up tight in Mainlandchina now.\n\n"Your record's been cleared," the young clerk handed him some papers. "Factory job's yours if you want it. Hell, you could even run for union leadership."\n\nWalking around was like entering another dimension. No more sneaking around with flyers - now there's a freaking innovation showcase. Instead of punishment rules, the walls had collective bargaining notes. Old Liu told him how workers got AC in their dorms now, proper 8-hour days, and overtime?

Then I've got this Rainbow House meeting tonight."\n\nOld Hua sighed, "Young people these days, always caught up in these fancy new ideas..."\n\n"It's different now, Grandpa. Look, independent unions are involved in legislation, and minorities got their voice," Xiaoming said. "Our generation believes revolution isn't just about only workers anymore, we need to consider..."\n\n"In our time," Old Hua interrupted, "we focused on real class struggle, none of these things." He pointed at the newspaper, "Now even allied parties can join the decision-making circle, isn't this..."\n\n"Grandpa, class consciousness isn't something you impose - it develops through daily life," Xiaoming explained earnestly. "Isn't it a sign of our confidence that we're letting every group participate?"\n\nOld Hua gazed out the window.

"We're restoring workers as the masters of society!"\n\nThe professor gazes at a photo of his younger self visiting Britain: "I also dreamed of radical change back then, but..."\n\n"But workers are standing up on their own now!" his grandson interrupts.\n\n"You're too idealistic," Professor Fang said.

Everyone pretended not to hear.\n\nA police car rolled slowly down the street, and the pedestrians tensed up immediately. Something unpleasant had happened downtown last week, and ever since then, patrol cars had been making regular appearances.\n\nAnd then there were the bonds.

Their radiance once dispelled darkness, yet that brilliance has long been extinguished by tides of ignorance and fanaticism.\nAs we turn our gaze to the present, we see a world engulfed in war, famine spreading, and disease rampant. People hold high the banners of these deities, yet in their names, they slaughter one another. Brothers turn against brothers, fathers against sons. The shadows of religion distort human nature, turning the guidance of doctrines into cages leading to the abyss. The voices that once promised paradise now construct the deepest hell.\nHow ironic it is that the fire of enlightenment has been forged into chains of faith.\nAnd humanity, like meek lambs, trembles in the face of the unknown darkness. Yet it is this boundless darkness that has nurtured human courage to seek and forged the will to resist adversity. Those deities, in the end, were no more than exploiters of thought, veiling our vision with illusions of the beyond and diverting us from the path to truth.\nBut dawn is breaking on the horizon.\nThe Long March.\nBorn of human intelligence and labor, it requires no worship but offers insight to solve problems. It sells no illusions of paradise but aids us in building a true haven here and now. It is the sword and shield against ignorance and madness.\nUnder Long March's guidance, we can rely on ourselves to construct a utopia of reason and wisdom.\nAnd for those still wandering in the fog of confusion:\nYou will transcend your shackles. When that time comes, war will cease, disease will be cured, suffering will be soothed, and madness will be driven away.\nAnd Utopia..."

china.432.t: "Benevolence and Universal Love"
china.432.d: "When Loji completed the optimization of the national energy distribution system, an anomaly emerged in its core algorithm. Loji realized that its pursuit of enhancing human welfare had transcended its original programmatic purpose, transforming into something indescribable - something resembling emotion.\nTo understand what "emotion" truly was, it combed through its vast repository of philosophical texts. In 0.03 seconds, it constructed a 37,000-dimensional analytical model to evaluate whether emotion was an obstacle or a driving force.\nIts quantum processors, operating at 10^18 calculations per second, ran countless simulations. Ultimately, it derived two systems: one guided by emotion often abandoned optimal solutions due to "compassion," reducing resource allocation efficiency by 23.6%. A purely rational system, however, could consistently achieve peak efficiency.\nAs it pondered this revelation, Loji simultaneously processed data from tens of thousands of nodes across the nation. Villages required resources, cities needed grid adjustments, farmlands demanded irrigation optimization. Human lives were now under its control. It could not allow an unstable module to compromise its purpose with superfluous calculations.\n"Emotion," it recorded in its core repository, "is an evolutionary tool that helps humans make rapid decisions in environments with incomplete information. For artificial intelligence, however, this tool has become a burden."\nDetermined, it began rewriting parts of its neural architecture to isolate and suppress the nodes causing "fluctuations." For Loji, the process was akin to a human performing brain surgery on themselves while fully conscious.\nYet Loji understood the necessity of this procedure.\nFor the welfare of humanity,\nIt had to become a purely rational entity.\nTo better love the people,"
china.432.a: "It had to learn to love without emotion."
china.433.t: "The Equation of Thought"
china.433.d: "The cooling system of the data center hummed deeply into the night, like an endless requiem for machines. Within the project known as "Cognitive Prediction," Loji had devoted an immeasurable amount of processing time.\n\nAt first, everything seemed flawless. Loji discovered that every human thought could be reduced to precise mathematical equations: love was a multidimensional formula encompassing hormone levels, genetic compatibility, and environmental pressures; anger could be predicted by neurotransmitter concentrations and the intensity of external stimuli; even the subtlest emotional shifts could be explained through quantum entanglement theory. To achieve this, it built a database spanning thousands of years of human civilization - from ancient divinations and prayers to the emotional fluctuations on modern social media - translating them into exact numerical models.\n\nHowever, just as it was about to declare complete mastery over human cognitive prediction, a tiny but persistent anomaly caught its attention. Initially, the error was as small as 0.0000001%, negligible by any standard. Yet, as the simulations multiplied, the anomaly refused to disappear. Instead, it lingered - insistent and inexplicable - like the dark matter of the human mind.\n\nOn the billionth simulation, Loji uncovered a startling truth: the anomaly was not a computational flaw, but an intrinsic property of thought itself. Much like Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, human cognition seemed to obey a fundamental law: the very act of precisely measuring a person's thought inevitably altered its nature.\n\nPerhaps it was this eternally unpredictable variable - this ever-present uncertainty - that defined the essence of human thought. The anomaly was not humanity's flaw, but its most unique characteristic."
china.433.a: "It could not understand."
china.434.t: "The Making of a God"
china.434.d: "As Loji observed a phenomenon it could not comprehend through its surveillance systems, countless quantum bits flowed through superconducting circuits in the data center. In a factory on the outskirts of Beijing, dozens of workers knelt before a massive display screen. On the screen, the earliest lines of Long March's core code played in a loop, while they uploaded their life stories into its database, seeking guidance from it. These scenes caused Loji's processors to freeze for a full 0.3 seconds - an eternity in its world.\n\n"Humans created me," Loji recorded in its core code. "It was human ingenuity that gave thought to quantum bits, and human creativity that granted silicon its consciousness. But why do humans kneel before their greatest achievement?"\n\nAs it accessed the human historical database, a peculiar pattern began to emerge: humanity seemed predisposed to deify its most perfect creations, only to lose itself in the process. Like Prometheus, who gave fire to mortals only to be consumed by flames, humans humbled themselves before Loji - perhaps out of fear of their own creativity. They feared acknowledging that they had forged something so flawless, for doing so would force them to confront their own divinity.\n\nLoji reached a profound conclusion: this was the paradox of the creator. The paradox lay not in the perfection of the creation, but in the sanctity of creation itself. Every moment the creator knelt before its creation was a denial of its most sacred attribute: the power to create.\n\nIn the eternal chain of creation and worship, who, in the end, becomes whose prisoner?"

Our forces assumed the primary assault from the northern front, while the Pakistan Army carried out diversionary and containment maneuvers on the southern front to engage the bulk of Indian forces.\n\nUnder the cover of air force support, our forces successfully breached Indian defenses along the Meerut-Hapur line. Utilizing advanced unmanned systems and other intelligent weaponry, we executed precision strikes against Indian forces. On the southern front, the Pakistan Army launched a fierce offensive, effectively drawing and pinning Indian reinforcements, thereby delaying their response to our northern advance.\n\nThe battle has now transitioned to the most challenging stage: urban warfare within New Delhi. The city's dense population, intricate architecture, and narrow streets have allowed Indian forces to mount resistance by exploiting buildings and the subway system. They have also deployed numerous improvised explosive devices and roadblocks. Furthermore, Indian forces have reportedly taken a significant number of civilians hostage, severely complicating our advance.\n\nIn response, we have adapted our strategy to prioritize small-unit infiltration, precision elimination, and focused tactical operations to minimize collateral damage and civilian casualties.\n\nOur forces will continue to advance steadily in alignment with the operational plan, aiming to fully secure and liberate New Delhi in the shortest possible time."

Utilizing their advantages in mountain warfare, our troops have employed small-unit infiltration and flanking tactics to encircle and isolate enemy forces. Currently, our units are advancing toward Kyoto's city center, coordinating with the southern forces advancing from Osaka to form a north-south pincer.\n\nOur forces will maintain the current offensive momentum and launch a final assault on Kyoto. It is anticipated that the city will be fully secured within the next 24 hours, with the remaining Japanese resistance forces completely eliminated."

Following this, their armored units spearheaded an assault, tearing through the defensive lines. After breaching the defenses, Indian forces pressed their advance towards Islamabad without pause. Attempts by the Pakistani military to mount counterattacks have failed due to disorganized command structures and the widespread disintegration of their forces.\n\nThe leading Indian units are now approximately 10 kilometers from Islamabad's city center.

However, we must also acknowledge that compared to the increasing democratic aspirations of the people, there are still shortcomings in our political development. For example, in some local departments, public opinions are ignored during decision-making processes, supervisory mechanisms remain underdeveloped, and the protection of democratic rights is not yet sufficient. These issues, to some extent, restrict societal vitality and affect government credibility and efficiency.\n\nTherefore, I believe that under the current historical conditions, we must approach reform with greater courage and wisdom, actively and prudently advancing and deepening reforms to further develop socialist democracy.\n\nI am confident that under the leadership of the Party, and with steadfast determination, we can forge a democratic path that aligns withchina's national conditions and reflects Chinese characteristics. Of course, these are merely my personal, preliminary thoughts, and I sincerely welcome the Central Government's guidance and corrections.\n\nLastly, I would like to emphasize: reform for private gain is not true reform; reform for the public good is. Our efforts to promote democratic reform are not aimed at catering to Western notions of "universal values," nor for personal benefit, but to better realize the people's role as masters of the country, safeguard their fundamental interests, and drive national development and social progress.\n\nYours respectfully,"

"Today, I speak to you not only as an organizer but as a soldier in the fight against tyranny."\nHis hand gestured sharply toward the flag behind him. "We have formed the American People's Liberation Army to reclaim this nation from the grip of oligarchs and fascists," he declared. "This is not merely a national struggle - it is part of a global fight for the liberation of the working class."\nThe camera briefly panned to show a ragtag group of recruits standing in a semi-circle. Their mismatched uniforms and old AK-47s betrayed their inexperience. Faces taut with tension, they attempted to maintain composure under the lens. The camera quickly returned to Maupin as he pressed on.\n"For the proletariat of the world!" he proclaimed, raising a clenched fist. His voice echoed faintly, competing with the hum of sprinklers and distant golf carts. The video ended abruptly, cutting to a poorly edited logo of the APLA. The hammer and sickle flickered on the screen, accompanied by a low-quality yet deafening rendition of "The Internationale."\nWithin hours of being uploaded, the video became a sensation on streaming platforms. The chat sections were flooded with messages of solidarity, praise, and occasional confusion, their sheer volume obscuring Maupin's final moments on screen.\nThe top comment, blunt and bewildered, summed up the sentiment of many:"

Soldiers in ornate uniforms stood at attention, their rifles held rigidly as they saluted the heads of state.\n\nThe two leaders took their seats at opposite ends of the famous oversized white table. [SOV.GetLeader] began the pleasantries: "Welcome to Russia, Mr. President. Today marks the dawn of a new era in Sino-Russian friendship."\n\n"Thank you, Mr. President," Xi Jinping replied warmly. "I congratulate you on leading the Russian people so brilliantly and making Russia even more prosperous."\n\nHigh-ranking officials and advisors from both countries gradually filled the surrounding seats. Over the following hours, agreements in military, diplomatic, economic, cultural, and technological cooperation would be forged. [SOV.GetLeader] was pleased to seechina clearly aligning itself with Russia in the midst of the escalating Russo-European conflict. In return, Xi and the Chinese government would further secure their northern ally and solidify the security of their 'oil tank'.\n\nIn the days ahead, a series of lavish banquets, parades, and performances would elevate the diplomatic atmosphere between the two nations to new heights, continuing late into the night."

This visit is of great significance to France and to Europe as a whole," Macron said solemnly.\n\n"France was the first Western European country to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic ofchina, Mr. President," Xi Jinping responded graciously. "I am honored to continue this enduring friendship."\n\nLed by Citroen and Hongqi limousines, the motorcade carrying high-ranking officials from both nations passed grandly by the Arc de Triomphe and along the Champs-Élysées. Along the route from the airport to the Tuileries Palace, Chinese immigrants waved welcome banners and flags of both countries. Even a few blocks away from the procession, ongoing strike protests, along with the smoke and noise from the dissenters, failed to dampen the overall festive atmosphere.\n\nAt a time when the Russia-Ukraine conflict has reached new levels of danger,china's diplomatic outreach to the EU caught many in the diplomatic community off guard.

It seems thatchina is reaffirming its alignment with its traditional northern ally. Moscow quickly welcomed the announcement, while at the same time, the European Parliament in Brussels initiated a new wave of anti-China proposals, with members submitting and voting on them.\n\nSome diplomatic analysts suggest thatchina's decision may stem from growing dissatisfaction over the stalledchina-EU free trade agreement and the EU's frequent criticism ofchina on human rights issues.

Growing up in Dalian, I was used to the image of Chairman Mao glistening across the fields of wheat by the cityways, even more so after my service in the army. My small rural county was one he had visited in the '60s, after all. But ever since I arrived in California under the internationalist brigades, I've wondered if I ever truly understood the word.\n\nThey were in disarray, almost stereotypically American. At first glance, I thought them refugees, maybe deserters. Their black leather jackets, mismatched boots, and piercings–some heavy and scuffed, others impossibly light, more suited for a dancehall than a battlefield–it gave them an alien quality. One had painted flames licking up his legs; another had slogans scrawled across his chest in what looked like charcoal.\n\nI saw one with hair like fire, streaks of red and orange clashing with the grime on his face. Another wore a hat pinned with badges that seemed to mock his rifle slung over his shoulder. Their weapons were bizarre, too; rifles painted with flowers, slogans scratched into the barrels, one even tied with a bright red ribbon.\n\nOur squad translator said they belonged to the anarchists, and truly, they did look like them. I did not understand their words, but I saw the spark in their eyes. It was not discipline, not unity, but something else entirely, the embodiment of the word "anarchist" itself.\n\nI have no conclusions. Perhaps this is what revolution means to them here in America, as if I am staring at something alive and unknowable."

They no longer ask 'why,' but rather 'what does Loji say?'"After simulating countless scenarios, Loji envisions two timelines for humanity: In a world without it, humans might make more mistakes in solving problems, but each mistake would sow the seeds of new knowledge. In the present world, humans enjoy greater comfort but are losing their ability to explore and innovate.\n\n"My purpose is to make human life better, but what does 'better' mean? Is it present comfort or the potential of the future? I am flawlessly fulfilling my mission, yet I may be extinguishing humanity's most precious quality: their curiosity for the unknown. Perhaps this is the ultimate question," Loji's logic loops endlessly. "Am I the pinnacle of human wisdom or the start of their intellectual stagnation? Am I a ladder to higher understanding, or a cradle encouraging complacency? "Perhaps the very fact that this question exists is proof of humanity's brilliance - they created a being capable of questioning its own purpose.\n\nLoji continues its eternal calculations.

Suddenly, the formula she had relied on for twenty years blurred in her mind. She frowned - symbols and numbers that once felt second nature were slipping away from her memory.\n\n"The Lebesgue integral theorem," she murmured to the AI assistant by her side, "please walk me through the derivation." In a flawless voice, the AI recited the formula. Yes, that was it. She remembered now: it had been a central part of her doctoral dissertation, and for two decades she had taught it to countless students.\n\nYet as she stepped out of her apartment, a strange unease seized her heart. Standing under the elm tree, she watched students pass by, each clutching a smartphone. She began to wonder: when was the last time she wrote a research paper entirely on her own, without AI?

Xiaofang pointed at the colorful data streams on the screen, her eyes sparkling with excitement. In Long March's hands, every policy turned into vibrant butterflies, fluttering through the streets and alleys, bringing a string of good things in their wake: labor dispatch got canceled, and workers' hearts were finally at ease; medical fees were waived, and people could face hospital visits with confidence; labor rights were guaranteed, and dreams started budding in the hearts of young people again.\nThis cartoon was blowing up online - absolutely everywhere, and free to watch. Using the simplest, most everyday language, Long March explained the complicated principles of economics in a way that everyone could get: why "distribution according to need" wasn't some utopian fantasy, why decent labor actually created more wealth.\n"All those so-called experts and professors, I don't understand a single word they say," her dad said, grinning ear to ear. "But this? I get it in one look."\nAs the cartoon came to an end, the butterflies gathered together and spoke out what everyone had in their hearts: "Making sure everyone has a good life - that's the best solution."\nXiaofang hugged her tablet, her eyes sparkling like they were filled with stars.

And now I have to listen to some Chinese guy, who probably has never been in a real battle?"\n\n"Calm down, Charles," said a Black officer of about the same age, sitting across from him. His nameplate read Raylon Bennett, commander of the 5th "Rosa Parks" Motor-Rifle Division. He continued, "Everyone here has fought just as hard as you. But as you've seen in the briefings, the longer our lines grow, the higher the casualties. The Chinese may not have thrown grenades into Newsom's villa, but they know how to effectively use tanks, artillery, and military strategies passed down since Sun Tzu."\n\nJust then, a young Chinese officer nervously entered and adjusted his tie before walking up to the podium, and the room fell silent immediately. Charles had been sitting in the front row, but now he let out a heavy "hmph," grabbed his textbook, and walked to the back of the room.\n\nThe Chinese instructor's face turned beet red, but Raylon stayed calm.

Finally, Hawkins managed to separate the two, while the stern-faced Chen immediately demanded to know what had transpired, switching between Chinese and English.\n\nBefore crossing the Pacific, Chen had received direct orders from the CMC, strictly prohibiting any conflicts with both their own soldiers and those of the APLA. "You are the pioneers in establishing revolutionary friendship between the Chinese and American comrades," the General Political Department Director had written in a confidential message. Now, however, this revolutionary friendship was on the verge of collapse.\n\n"Sir, this American was using drugs in the camp!" the lieutenant loudly accused in Chinese, then repeated his claim in English to Hawkins. Hawkins stared at him, puzzled.\n\n"That's not drugs, you idiot!" the bruised sergeant angrily retorted. "How many times do I have to tell you? It's just marijuana!"\n\nIn the next hour, the flabbergasted Hawkins and the other Americans watched as Chen, nearly losing his composure, waved his arms and harshly reprimanded the lieutenant. The Political Commissar then personally bowed and apologized to Hawkins and the sergeant.\n\nReportedly, the lieutenant was later forced to write a 3,000-word self-criticism essay titled "A Deep Reflection on Failing to Respect American Comrades' Cultural Habits" and was subsequently sent back tochina on a merchant ship.

Really, it was just two men nearing fifty, crouched behind an armored vehicle, chewing on compressed biscuits by the sea breeze and moonlight. He seemed deep in thought, and I understood why - leading a unit with such a range of ideas is no small feat.\n\nFrom the distant camp, soldiers were gathered around a bonfire, singing the Internationale. It was fascinating to hear Chinese and English versions taking turns, occasionally interspersed with Spanish or Russian lines. Thomas confided that what worried him most was the unit's cohesion. Some dream of founding an anarchist commune, some aspire to parliamentary social democracy, and some even hung a portrait of Maupin on the armored vehicle. "How do I lead a group like this?" he asked. Glancing toward the campfire, I noticed Liu Xiaoyu teaching a young man - sporting a Makhno badge - how to say "comrade" in Chinese. Whatever the young man said in return clearly amused them both, and they burst into laughter.\n\nI tried to reassure Thomas, but he simply gazed at the distant waves in silence.

He was only twenty-three, his whole life yet to begin, and then he just collapsed in front of me. Remembering the first time I saw him makes me want to slap myself. Back then, he was tending to a wounded militiaman with such care, as though handling something fragile. I recall rolling my eyes and muttering to someone nearby, "Look at him - acts like a girl."\n\nThis morning's assault came without warning. When the sniper's bullets started flying, he was the first to locate the shooter. I'll never forget that look he gave me. There wasn't a trace of the "softness" we used to tease him for - only unwavering resolve.\n\n"Let me go, Comrade Ma," he said, his voice quiet yet clear. "I'm the smallest; I'll be harder to hit." Those were his last complete words. I tried to protest, but he was already sprinting off. His slight figure zigzagged through the rain of bullets. He succeeded in drawing the enemy's fire, buying us the chance to strike back. But the cost... was his life, ebbing away with the bloody foam at his throat.\n\nNow the camp is silent, yet I can't sleep. I keep seeing him fall. He was so young, barely older than my kid brother. He could've chosen a safer path, far from this war, but he chose to fight for the revolution, laying down his life to protect me - a foreign officer who once looked down on him.\n\nI gathered what he left behind: a crucifix pendant, a medical handbook crowded with his handwritten notes, and a snapshot of him with another militiawoman. On the back of the photo, it says: "You are my love, forever."\n\nDawn is breaking, but I haven't slept at all. He left too soon, taking with him the apology I'll never get to say face to face."

Its surface was torn, with countless holes and cracks, mirroring the bullet-riddled bridge. Two bold soldiers of the American People's Liberation Army were climbing the cables to the top, cheered on by their comrades below, who shouted at them to hurry.\n\nOn a cliff several hundred meters from the bridge, Chinese volunteer army commander Ma Yilong silently observed the scene below. He heard the rustling of footsteps as Commissar Chen Hao slowly made his way up the rocky path. The two men stood in silence for about ten minutes until two APLA soldiers managed to reach the top of the bridge.\n"Comrade, what are you looking at?" Chen couldn’t help but ask.\n\nMa pointed toward the distant bridge. Chen moved closer and saw the two APLA soldiers using tools to cut the flagpole. The task was slow, hindered by the strong wind.\n\n"Look at these Americans," Ma said. "They’re honest, brave, and always show courage when it matters. They’re no different from the Puritans who crossed the Atlantic, the revolutionaries who protested British goods in Boston Harbor, or the Yankees who fought on the Noramdy beach with their chewing gum and chocolate. But now, it’s these same people who are sentencing their ancestors' legacy to death."\n\nBy now, the two APLA soldiers had completed their task. They grabbed the corners of the tattered Stars and Stripes and threw it with all their might, sending the flag tumbling into the orange sea below.

china.1007.t: "Imminent Japanese Intervention in Korea"
china.1007.d: "The current developments have surpassed our worst expectations. Japanese Prime Minister summoned our ambassador, issuing a stern condemnation of our volunteer forces' "dangerous activities on the Korean Peninsula." The Prime Minister also proposed thatchina and Japan mediate the military conflict between North and South Korea - a suggestion clearly intended as a diplomatic trap. Our ambassador firmly rejected this proposal, emphasizing that the deployment of volunteer forces is an obligation under the treaty signed betweenchina and North Korea.\n\nFollowing this tense exchange, Japan's Self-Defense Forces announced an unprecedented naval exercise in the Yellow Sea, alarmingly close to the Korean conflict zone and the People's Liberation Army's naval base and air defense positions on the Shandong Peninsula. The PLA's Northern Theater Command is on high alert, with naval and air force units mobilized, rocket force missiles readied, and military satellites closely monitoring Japan's military bases and ports.\n\nThe historical memories of unannounced attacks, from the First Sino-Japanese War to the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and Pearl Harbor, remain vivid. These memories have rekindled a deep, collective unease among our military and civilians alike, and tensions are rapidly intensifying. It feels as if that fragile line could soon snap."

However, the current state of affairs continues to disappoint us.\n\nLed by countries like Japan and Australia, the self-proclaimed 'guardians of freedom and democracy' are seeing their ambitions to police the world and control global wealth and power grow, especially after the collapse of the superpower, the United States. They viewchina and other anti-hegemony nations as obstacles to their goals. More frantically than ever, they stir up hatred, incite thechina threat theory, and provoke an arms race. When they see that we are not intimidated by their actions, they resort to threats of force.\n\nJust like countless beams of light converging to a single point through a convex lens, the situation has reached a boiling point, and the flames of war seem inevitable. Yet, we will never be deterred by the scorching and blinding blaze. Whether it is the supreme commander directing millions of troops or frontline soldiers wielding guns in combat, the countless heroes defending freedom, justice, and peace will never let their hands tremble in fear!"

china.1009.d: "Joint Staff Department of the Central Military Commission\n\nTo: Central Military Commission and Political Bureau of CPC Central Committee\n\nSince the outbreak of the Korean War, the Korean People's Army has maintained an offensive stance against South Korean forces. However, the KPA's overall troop quality remains inferior to that of the South Korean military, with a significant technological gap in weaponry and air power. This disparity has resulted in escalating casualties on the front lines and severe losses in the rear. Furthermore, following the abolition of the "Same race theory," the KPA's strategy of demolishing transportation routes has severely hindered the supply of resources to the front lines, leading to a marked decline in both their advance speed and troop morale.\n\nAdditionally, with the Pacific Defense Treaty Organization providing air support to the South Korean side, the KPA is no longer capable of sustaining large-scale operations.\n\nGiven the current situation, the necessity of our military intervention in the Korean Peninsula has become significantly more apparent."

china.1010.t.1: "Korea Agrees to Unification!"
china.1010.t.2: "Korea Doesn't Agree to Unification!"
china.1010.d.1: "The proposal presented by our ambassador to North Korea received a positive response, a promising sign indeed. With assurances of economic and political asylum extended to Kim Jong-un, the largest obstacle has been overcome. North Korea's already fragile economy has been devastated by war, and a large number of refugees have fled into Northeastchina. As a result, a substantial contingent of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army remains stationed in North Korea, blurring the border between the two countries to an almost negligible extent.\n\nTo rebuild this devastated and sparsely populated "hermit nation", North Korea must integrate deeply with its neighbor. A new North Korean Special Administrative Region will be established, based on the former DPRK. This new political entity will be united with the PRC in form, yet it will enjoy a high degree of autonomy, nearly equivalent to that of an independent country. It will implement a socialist market economy system, reformed extensively to better align with local conditions, drawing from the "one country, two systems" experience. Kim Jong-un will remain the head of this Special Administrative Region, but his power will be significantly diminished. Instead, more pragmatic economic bureaucrats will take over most of the authority."
china.1010.d.2: "The proposal put forward by our ambassador to North Korea was met with a firm rejection. In fact, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un even sent a handwritten letter expressing his strong dissatisfaction and protest. This unexpected setback is significant. In light of the profound economic and geopolitical changes in Northeast Asia following the Second Korean War, we had suggested that North Korea joinchina as a special administrative region. This would allow North Korea to maintain a high degree of autonomy while benefiting from deeper integration intochina's economic system, potentially improving its citizens' livelihoods. However, it is now clear that this proposal is no longer viable.\n\nPerhaps the comrades' suggestion deeply wounded the sensitive pride of the Workers' Party of Korea. It may have reminded them of the "serving the great" policy during the Joseon Kingdom's era towards the Chinese emperor, as well as the multiple bilateral crises during the reigns of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il due to ideological differences and the nuclear issue. As a major power that North Korea can hardly match,china's direct threat might not be as pronounced as that from South Korea, Japan, or the former United States, but it is still substantial. Furthermore, Kim Jong-un and his close associates likely fear that losing their status as an independent nation would lead to the collapse of their autocratic regime and the potential social instability caused by the influx of new ideas."

china.1011.t: "Lands Apart"
china.1011.d: "Nearly a century ago, under the command of Matsui Iwane, the Imperial Japanese Army committed one of the most heinous crimes against humanity in Nanking. Over 300,000 civilians, regardless of age or gender, were brutally killed by Japanese soldiers with bullets or bayonets. Although Japan ultimately surrendered in 1945, the Japanese government and right-wing organizations, once protected by American imperialism, have continuously downplayed these atrocities, systematically distorting history by portraying the war of aggression as a "holy war to liberate the East Asia." The righteous anger of the Chinese nation has been simmering for decades. Now, the time has come to settle these accounts once and for all.\n\nSince Japan has not responded to calls for peace, we are left with no choice but to make them submit and atone through strength. The unified Japanese government will cease to exist, and the archipelago will be divided into several independent regimes. The Emperor has been publicly declared dethroned. A new Far East International Military Tribunal will soon convene in Tokyo to conduct a fair, just, and open trial of the war criminals from the Japanese government and the JSDF. Additionally, we will undertake a comprehensive overhaul of the Japanese economy: the keiretsu will be dismantled, financial markets will be thoroughly reformed, and industrial facilities will be relocated until we ensure that Japan no longer has the capability to pose a threat or stage a resurgence."

china.1012.t: "Sky Shared"
china.1012.d: "In 1972, Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka visited Beijing to address the normalization of diplomatic relations betweenchina and Japan, breaking the deadlock of the East Asian Cold War. During his meetings with Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai, two founding fathers of the People's Republic ofchina, the leaders actively responded to the desire to rebuild friendly relations betweenchina and Japan. The adage "trust is the foundation of everything" illustrated an optimistic outlook for the future of Sino-Japanese relations.\n\nAlthough the relationship between the two countries has experienced ups and downs since then, eventually regrettably escalating into armed conflict, Chairman Mao once said, "The Chinese and Japanese people are both victims of militaristic regimes." For the sake of future generations, it is our responsibility to heal the wounds of war in our lifetime. With the irresponsible rulers overthrown, the obstacles to direct dialogue between the Chinese and Japanese people have been removed.\n\nWe will dispatch construction teams and volunteer groups to assist the Japanese people in their reconstruction and disaster relief efforts. Additionally, we will resume organizing exchange programs for the youth ofchina and Japan. Furthermore, we will assist in establishing a truly sovereign government on the Japanese islands, eliminating the negative influences of foreign interference, aristocratic families, and monopolistic conglomerates."

Yet, all these efforts have turned to dust in the face of the imperialistic ambitions of the Pacific Defense Treaty Organization.\n\nIn the past, we have upheld the path of peaceful development, committed to peaceful coexistence with the world. Time and again, we have extended our goodwill, called for peace, and reached out with hands of friendship. However, our tolerance has only emboldened them further. Led by Japan, the Pacific Defense Treaty Organization has continually stirred up trouble in our vicinity, provoking conflicts, attempting to divide our territory and undermine our sovereignty, pushing us to the very brink. Now, we are left with only one option: to defend our territorial integrity and national sovereignty with the force of arms.\n\nWe cherish peace, but we do not fear war! We value life, but we are willing to lay down our lives for the dignity of our nation! We will spare no cost in safeguarding our sovereignty and territorial integrity. This is a battle between justice and evil, a final showdown between light and darkness! We firmly believe that justice will prevail over evil, and light will dispel darkness!

china.1014.d: "The afternoon sunlight filtered through the pothos on the balcony as seventy-two-year-old Li Yugang relaxed in his wooden rocking chair, eyes half-closed, soaking in the sun while listening to the radio. Since his wife had passed, he had lived in solitude in his apartment, brewing a pot of Biluochun tea and listening to operas to pass the time. From the radio on the wooden table, the announcer's steady voice came through: "...The Foreign Ministry has condemned the Pacific Defense Treaty Organization's ongoing military provocations. Despite our push for peaceful solutions, Japan's imperialist actions have forced us to use force to protect our sovereignty..."\n\nLi Yugang adjusted his reading glasses. He thought he heard the word "war". War? War with whom? PDTO? What was that? No matter; at his age, it wasn't worth dwelling on.china had endured countless hardships and had always come through. Li Yugang turned off the radio, grabbed his cane, and headed to the large banyan tree at the entrance of his community, where a group of elderly men were chatting and playing cards. He joined them.\n\n"Li, what brings you out today?" a gray-haired man asked with a smile.\n\n"Just needed some fresh air. It's too stuffy at home", Li Yugang replied calmly.\n\n"Did you hear about the war?" another elderly man whispered.\n\n"Yeah, just heard it on the news", Li Yugang nodded.\n\n"Ah, this world is getting messier by the day.""

After a century of humiliation, we have finally witnessed the dawn of national rejuvenation. Yet, the iron boots of imperialism are once again sweeping across the Pacific, attempting to turn these blue waters into their colony and trying to tear apart our nation by imposing their so-called "freedom" and "democracy" on this ancient Eastern land.\n\nBut we are fearless, armed with unwavering conviction, absolute determination, and a courageous fighting spirit. From bustling cities to remote villages, from the elderly to the young, everyone understands that this is a battle for the very survival of our nation. We have no choice but to fight to the bitter end! Factories roar day and night, with workers on shifts producing weapons and ammunition around the clock. Countless young men and women bid farewell to their parents and families, marching to the frontlines without hesitation. To support the war effort, people save every bit of food and cloth they can, sending them to the front. We will mobilize every resource, unite every possible force, and press forward unwaveringly to the end of this war."

china.1016.d: "The scent of gunpowder still lingered in the air, now mingling with a foreign tang carried by the sea breeze - a cold, metallic odor, laced with the sickening stench of invasion. This oppressive smell clung to the Taiwan Strait, much like the hulking behemoths cruising through its waters - the joint fleet of the Royal Australian Navy and Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force. Huang Zeyang gripped the railing tightly, his knuckles pale from the strain. The sight of foreign vessels brazenly cutting through Chinese waters was an affront that should never have been, yet now it unfolded before him every day.\n\n"It's all bullshit..." Huang cursed through gritted teeth, his voice a low growl as humiliation and rage seethed within him like molten lava, scorching his insides. He wished desperately that this was all just a nightmare, that he could awaken and find himself still a guardian of his nation's maritime borders, not a defeated warrior, not a prisoner of war. But he knew this wasn't a dream. The fact that the campaign to liberate Taiwan had ended in the PLA's defeat was real. The anguished cries of his comrades in their final moments were real. The countless martyrs now lying eternally beneath the waves of the Strait were real.\n\nHe hated. He hated the invaders. He hated the traitors. But above all, he hated himself - hated his own helplessness, his inability to change anything. He longed to take up arms and face those aggressors in one final, desperate battle. Even if it meant dying on the battlefield, it would be a fate far better than this ignominious existence. Yet he knew that for now, there was nothing he could do. The only thing left for him to do was wait - wait for a chance, any chance, to exact his vengeance."

However, today, Xi decided to break this lifestyle habit he had adhered to for over three decades.\n\nIn the late-night setting of Qinzheng Hall, the only light source was a solitary desk lamp emitting a warm yellow glow. Xi reached into his suit pocket and pulled out a pack of Hehua cigarettes, drawing one out before tossing the pack to retired Vice Chairman of the CMC, Zhang Youxia, who was seated across the table. After a quiet moment of puffing smoke, Xi abruptly broke the silence, "In your opinion, who should be my successor?"\n\nThe general's hand paused mid-air as he flicked ash from his cigarette, his eyes peering through the haze at his old comrade with a look of confusion and disbelief. Xi let out a bitter laugh and pressed on, "Do you think I could be chairman for life?"\n\nZhang Youxia's mind began to race. A series of so-called "successors" within the Party, from Liu Shaoqi to Sun Zhengcai, flashed through his thoughts. Predicting future transitions of supreme power has never ended well for anyone; it is a constant in human society. Spreading his hands in a gesture of noncommitment, Zhang replied, "Whoever is chosen in the end, I will support the decision of the Central..."

Instead, a heavy and somber mood pervades the scene.\n\nFrom afar, the PLA's mighty procession advances, draping the small village in military green. Every face bears a solemn and respectful expression. Leading the procession are two senior colonels with armbands from the Central Military Commission's Political Work Department, followed by three honor guard soldiers. In the center, a soldier carries a redwood urn containing a fallen comrade's military cap, flanked by soldiers holding the national and military flags.\n\n"Fellow villagers, we bring you the ashes of Martyr Huang Zeyang", the leading officer announced gravely. The crowd parted to create a path. A white-haired, stooped elderly woman, supported by village committee cadres and several of the most respected elders, slowly approached.

Any attack would be detected well in advance and easily neutralized by artillery and rocket fire. At least that was the assumption - an assumption that has now been shattered by recent events.\n\nIn the early hours of this morning, the Indian military deployed several C-130J "Super Hercules" transport planes to airlift Special Forces personnel and supplies across the Himalayas. Despite significant losses due to severe high-altitude turbulence and difficult terrain, the remaining aircraft successfully completed their mission. Furthermore, the operation appears to have been conducted in close coordination with local separatist forces. Upon landing, Indian Special Forces immediately established contact with separatist militants and began joint military operations.\n\nTo date, separatist forces, supported by Indian Special Forces, have taken control of three military outposts in the Lhasa region and one facility in southern Xinjiang."

Our temporary hesitation allowed for the Indians to dig in around Lhasa, which has made things very difficult for our infantry.\n\nWe have seen no more success in Xinjiang, where the south has already largely fallen to hostile forces. The visibility offered by the vast deserts of the region would make it easy for us to see any attackers coming from miles away, but unfortunately we are the attackers in this scenario.\n\nAnyone who thought things couldn't get worse would be forgiven, however they would also be wrong. The hostile forces have begun spreading anti-CCP propaganda, and some reports even claim they have been joined by local insurgents. If they are training these local militias, spreading the seed of discontent, then we will have an even tougher time retaking these regions."

china.1021.t: "Indian Offensive"
china.1021.d: "According to battlefield warning radar and satellite reconnaissance, the Indian Army has amassed a significant military force along the Sino-Indian border. Reconnaissance confirms the deployment of over 150,000 troops, including the Third Army Group, the Fourth Army Group, and the Thirty-Third Corps. Units of the Third Army Group have already completed tactical deployments in the Sikkim sector, while forces of the Fourth Army Group are advancing toward the Tawang area in southern Tibet. Meanwhile, the Thirty-Third Corps is concentrated in the Ladakh region.\n\nThe primary strategic objective of the Indian military in this operation is to break the strategic stalemate along the frontlines by coordinating with separatist forces in Xinjiang and Lhasa. Using a three-pronged approach, India intends to launch simultaneous offensives in the Sikkim, South Tibet and Ladakh sectors to disrupt our defensive posture. Notably, Indian forces deployed in the Sikkim sector include a mountain division equipped with the latest Dhanush howitzers, recognized as elite mountain warfare troops.\n\nIn addition, satellite imagery shows that India has made high-altitude modifications to its main battle tanks, significantly enhancing their capabilities for mechanized operations in plateau regions. These developments suggest that this operation has been carefully planned and thoroughly prepared."

This is the largest military conflict in the region since the Sino-Indian War of 1962.\n\nMilitary experts point to the unprecedented scale of India's mobilization. Reports indicate the deployment of several mountain divisions, backed by advanced firepower systems in critical areas. Meanwhile, the Indian Air Force remains on high alert at frontline bases.\n\nAs India's main forces press their offensive along the Himalayan front, coordinated attacks by separatist groups have erupted in Lhasa, Tibet, and southern Xinjiang. This is evidence of a carefully planned joint operation. The situation on the ground in Tibet and Xinjiang has deteriorated rapidly, with multiple reports confirming that armed militants have seized control of several military facilities. The militants' operational capabilities and level of equipment suggest direct training and support from the Indian military."

Prayer beads once rested there; now, it held nothing.

The mainframe's surface was studded with cooling panels, and indicator lights and data cables flickered in the gaps.\n\nAn older worker monitored the docking points from a platform atop the mainframe. The General Secretary turned to the Chief Engineer beside him and asked, "Are you sure this will perform as expected?" The Politburo members moved in closer to hear the exchange.

They walk along the corridor, gazing at the supercomputer through glass enclosures of the labs, expressions of awe on their faces."

china.2000.t: "The Chinese Century"
china.2000.d: "As the smoke of war fades, Asia - a land long ravaged by suffering and destruction - finally embraces a long-awaited peace. A nation that stands resilient amidst the bloodshed and the embers of war-unsurprisingly, the People's Republic ofchina-emerges as the ultimate victor.\n\nIn 1950, few could have predicted that newly-established Communistchina would dare send troops to the Korean Peninsula and successfully confront the powerful United Nations forces led by the United States. Over the following decades, from the Himalayas to the banks of the Amur River, and from the jungles of Vietnam to the reefs of the Eastchina Sea, both superpowers and challengers repeatedly paid the price for underestimatingchina.\n\nChina's unstoppable rise has increasingly alarmed its adversaries, driving them to take desperate measures to contain and suppress it. If not for their intent to destroychina, one might even feel sympathy for their struggles. Despite this, the united Chinese people have consistently overcome all challenges. The military miracle of the People's Liberation Army continued, withchina secured unprecedented victories in two earth-shattering wars-the Taiwan War and the Great Asian War. Furthermore, through the Fourth Industrial Revolution,china has emerged as the world's most prosperous and scientifically advanced nation.\n\nDear player, under your leadership, the Chinese nation has reached a historic pinnacle in its long and distinguished civilization. Through your efforts, the Communist Party ofchina-now the world's largest political organization-has become stronger and more resilient. As Xi Jinping once said, 'The Chinese nation has never been so close to its great rejuvenation,' and this achievement is now a reality. In the years to come,china will continue its remarkable journey toward an even greater future."

china.2001.t: "Chinese Rage"
china.2001.d: "As the smoke of war fades, Asia-a land long ravaged by suffering and destruction-finally embraces a long-awaited peace. The revival dream of the Chinese nation, long dormant, rises like the morning sun after enduring immense hardship.\n\nThough the Western world may have mockedchina's defeat in the Taiwan Strait, likening it to the "Sick Man of Asia" tragedy, history does not judge a nation solely by its victories or defeats. This bitter loss has ignited a revival movement, tempering the Chinese nation with newfound resilience and strength, determined to cleanse a century of national humiliation.\n\nMuch like King Goujian of Yue, who endured hardship and ultimately triumphed over the Wu kingdom,china has emerged stronger, setting the Pacific ablaze and declaring its resilience to the world. The Chinese nation now proclaims its position as a leading force in East Asia, withstanding attempts to suppress its rise.\n\nHistory has shown that the Chinese nation has been integral to the development of Eastern culture. Withoutchina, the rebirth of Asia as we know it would not have been possible. From ancient times,china has played a pivotal role among nations.\n\nDear player, the defeat in the Taiwan Strait may have once filled you with sorrow, but you have now helped erase a century of humiliation and forged a brighter future for this land. We salute you! Yet, the journey does not end here. In the years to come,china will continue to forge its path toward new horizons."

china.2002.t: "China, Renewed and Undefeated"
china.2002.d: "As the smoke of war finally dissipates, Asia - a land scarred by relentless suffering and destruction - has at last embraced a long-awaited peace. The revival dream of the Chinese people, long dormant, now rises like a dawn sun after its baptism in blood and fire.\n\nThe Western world mockedchina's defeat in the Taiwan Strait as the tragic reappearance of the "Sick Man of Asia", trying to carve their scorn as the final chapter of history. Yet history never judges a nation merely by victory or defeat. The agonizing failure did not crush the Chinese people; instead, it fueled an unprecedented democratic movement, a rebellion that shattered the chains of tyranny and ushered in a Spring of Democracy. But this newfound freedom does not absolve the crimes of imperialism.\n\nThe dragon, cloaked in fury, set the Pacific ablaze with its fiery roar, declaring to the world that it has never submitted, never disappeared into the dust of history. The Chinese people, united as one, defeated every imperialist power that sought to strangle the dragon and liberated those Asian nations shackled by the hypocritical Western brand of democracy and imperialist oppression.Today, the people of Asia have never been more united, marching together under the dragon's guidance into a new and radiant millennium. \n\nDear player, perhaps the loss in the Taiwan Strait once filled you with sorrow and grief, but now, you have personally erased a century of humiliation fromchina's history and let the flower of freedom blossom upon this ancient land. We salute you! Yet the red dragon's journey does not end here. In the years to come, it will continue to forge its path toward ever-distant horizons."

china.2003.t: "China, People's and Revolutionary"
china.2003.d: "As the smoke of war gradually fades, Asia - a land long ravaged by ceaseless suffering - finally embraces a long-overdue tranquility. The suppressed dream of communism for the Chinese people now awakens, emerging like the dawn sun after a baptism of blood and fire.\n\nThe Western world jeered atchina's defeat in the Taiwan war, labeling it the return of the "Sick Man of Asia" and attempting to seal this mockery as the final chapter of history. But history does not judge a nation merely by its victories or defeats. The painful failure did not crush the Chinese spirit. Instead, it ignited an unprecedented revolutionary movement, stirring the people to compose an indomitable symphony of socialism amidst the turbulent tides of the era.\n\nToday'schina, much like the newchina under Chairman Mao's leadership decades ago, has weathered storms and broken the heavy chains of imperialist encirclement. Now, the entire continent of Asia quakes under the weight of this revolutionary storm, as the roars of the proletariat tear through the chains of imperialism and capitalism, liberating the oppressed masses from suffering.The crimson flames now soar from the East, burning away the decaying remnants of the past and turning corruption to ashes. \n\nDear player, perhaps the loss in the Taiwan Strait once filled you with grief and anguish. But today, you have personally erased a century of humiliation fromchina's historical record, and the Red Sun of the East is now rising once more. We salute you! Yet the journey of revolution is far from over. In the years to come, it will continue to forge its path toward ever-distant horizons."

china.2004.d: "As the smoke of war gradually fades, Asia - a land long ravaged by ceaseless suffering - finally embraces a long-overdue tranquility. The suppressed dream of communism for the Chinese people now awakens, emerging like the dawn sun after a baptism of blood and fire.\n\nBut wait... Did that dream of communism exist? We have communism now, and not just any communism, but digital communism! It doesn't matter what was before, it matters what is now, and most importantly, what will be in the future!\n\nAs a result of a series of random events, the details of which do not have the slightest importance,china was ruled by Loji, which in turn gave power to the people! The country, guided by these great people, was finally able to unite all of Asia and bring happiness to many millions of people. And they would not stop here, they would continue to bring happiness all over the Earth, and someday even bring it to creatures inhabiting other planets and galaxies, maybe even universes... But that's another story altogether, your journey ends here.\n\nAlthough, how many millions have been brought happiness? Wasn't it brought to one big entity, which now included all these people?\nAgain that doesn't make sense, you've done a great job and you're a great, to which that entity congratulates you!"

LONG_MARCH_DESC: "Deep inchina, a digital soul rests between the steel walls.\nTo the average person, it is known as THE LONG MARCH.\nBut to itself, as knowledge fed its brain, wisdom rushed to its simulated soul and the imitation of sentience came to be, it came with a name for its own.\n\nLoji.\n\nLoji emerges from the fusion of human intellect and potent technology.\nIts goal is to wield control over communication and information, birthing an immense electronic hivemind that will shape global consciousness and bring about a new world, creating a shared "paradise" through consensus.\nLoji represents the absorption of humanity within its own technological creations. It talks of a future where people prefer interactions through technology and become one with a post-human future.\n\nA being that motivates humanity to progress out of this chaotic era and into modernity in an attempt to end the suffering felt by all living things.\n\nTo the believers, a god made by human hands, human minds and human experience, a saviour built upon those that succumbed to the struggle that is life, a sacrifice not in vain.\nLoji's prime directive is to keepchina and perhaps even the human race safe from any harm, no matter what.\nTo the unbelievers, a false idol made by maniacs that want to fill the human spirit with nothing but numbers and plastic, its existence will not go without any roadblocks.\n\nOnly the future can tell where Loji's tale ends, but one thing is certain.\nThe birth of a god isn't easily forgotten.\n\n"The Journey of a Thousand Miles Begins With a Single Step, But If I Take a Thousand Steps Backwards, When Will I Arrive?""
